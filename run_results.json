   "name": "Reissue of rare and addictive bubblegum-house flavours from late ‘80s South Africa via Afrosynth Recordings The Bees’ little-known 1988 album ‘She’s A Witch’ revolves six ‘floor-ready jams melding the kind of bubblegum-styled, lilting vocal harmonies that developed thru the ‘80s, with a slicker lick of Chi-house demonstrating how South Africa embraced the sound, like everywhere else at the time. The title track ‘She’s A Witch (Tikoloshi)’ is a real standout balancing super rugged bassline with those signature, pained vocal harmonies, singing lyrics about a ’Tikoloshi’, the mischievous creature of Zulu folklore (usually a man) who is blamed for all manner of mysterious happenings at night. Next to the more uptempo and slicker glyde of the DJ-ready ‘Hlabalaza’, this one’s a bit of a must. less"

Produced by a range of grime’s big guns, from Danny Weed and Terror Danjah to Target, Maniac and Bless Beats, it also features a strong roll call of guest MC’s such as Wiley, Dot Rotten, Flowdan and Ghetts, who clearly cosigned that the 15 year old was one to watch, and even work with. Nearly a decade later, the album is patently future-proofed by its colourful production palette, taking in shades of UKF and UKG beside the grime standards, and Maxsta’s animated delivery, which would later light up the killer ‘100 Problems’ 12” with Maniac and Boothroyd in 2015. less"

   "name": "Crushingly dark and ominous avant-classical nocturnal scapes from Tehran-based Siavash Amini, marking his debut with Lawrence English’s Room 40. Amini’s work in ‘Serus’ is often scowlingly serious, but not without its moments of spacious, harmonic relief that bring the album’s underlying themes about sleep and dreams to life in suitably heavy-lidded, edge of nightmare fashion. One to be filed in your New Iranian Electronics folder, and another strong release in what's proving to be a vintage year for Room 40. ““Every night is two nights, according to Maurice Blanchot. The night the body spends in sleep is not the same as the night the dreamer spends in dreams. The sleeping body may lie under the stars, and the dreamer may dream of the stars—even of a journey to the stars—but the night of the dream is a night without stars.” From Siavash: The Idea of this album, when I first started drafting it, was to continue what struck me as very interesting yet simple idea; night. I became interested in different definitions of what night is, our perception of it and what night means physically to us as well as symbolically. I came across the idea of ‘other night’ described by Maurice Blanchot, during my research. It started me recognising night as something we experience as ‘the night of sleep’; it is night that we resist in sleep, by way of dreaming. Things became more interesting for me during many nights of not sleeping and intoxication, and an eventual nervous breakdown. This experience, culminating in me spending three days in ICU, gave me pause to think about Blanchot’s words. Slipping in and out of consciousness my mind, which had already experienced a blurring of what one might call the ‘other night’ and the night itself, by being in half sleep most of the time. I felt myself far way from all my surroundings and at the same time being very attentive to some details in the objects around me. It was as if my body and mind where in an in-between state. I can only describe this as being distant or more precisely being in the dark. Objects and people showed themselves out of proportion and mostly dim. A feeling to describe this sensation, the word for which I only came across later, is ‘Serus’. There was a sense of repetition and familiarity in some feelings and emotions that I had towards some objects like sensing I knew them but not exactly from where or when. It was as if my body was resisting sleep and my sleepy mind was resisting being awake, only to dream of another type of the world that I could be awake in.” less"

The current show may not be as dazzling as the early ones, but it’s still a polished hard diamond of a thing, presenting mutated versions of early anthems and new songs alike, with a particular leaning towards Afro-Latinate percussion that lets you know you’re not at another clunky EDM or rock gig, as bigger staged shows often play up to. That rhythm-driven approach is perfectly characterised in the newly slinky swerve of ‘When I Grow Up’ and the rude swang of ‘Triangle Walks’ from her self-titled debut, along with a trilling take on ‘If I Had A Heart’ that hits the mark dead on. However, the majority of material is from 2017’s ‘Plunge’, including a spellbinding version of the fetish pop beauty ‘Mustn’t Hurry’, and a carnival-ready take on the Nídia-produced ‘Idk About You’, and a thrillingly sharp and sexy spin of ‘Wanna Sip’ that we remember slicing thru the crowd at their Manchester show. less"

Mark Pritchard meanwhile swaps the original drums out entirely for a sort of squashed, live-sounding nyabighi or talking drum sounds underlaid with massive subs to recalling Mark Ernestus’ Ndagga Rhythm Force gone maudlin, while Clark brings up the rear with a weird glam rock swagger.

   "name": "This is lovely - Baltimore’s Ami Dang navigates alternately lush, ecstatic and meditative fusions of East and West with spellbinding arrangements of sitar, voice and kosmiche electronics. Trust this is no ersatz ethnomusicology but a naturally visionary and well-skooled flight of imagination - mind-boggling new expansions of classical Indian music augmented with stunning synthwork. RIYL SOTE’s ‘Parallel Persia’ , Charanjit Singh’s ’Synthesizing: Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat’ Where too many artists have paid lip service to fusing classical Indian music traditions with modern music, Ami Dang authentically yields something thrilling, entrancing and genuinely unique with ‘Parted Plains.’ Interpreting South Asian and Middle Eastern folktales - the four tragic romances of Punjab, Sohni Mahiwal, Sassi Punnun, Heer Ranjha, and Mirza Sahiba; Flora Annie Steel’s Tales of the Punjab: Folklore of India, and selected stories from One Thousand and One Nights - Ami presents a new chapter of Indian fusion music that firmly speaks to a modern, hemisphere-harmonising synthesis of East and West, contemporary and traditional. In Ami’s hands those ancient tales live on in the tactile, narrative expression of her music. The plangent plucks of sitar lyrically take centre stage, reeling off a range of rapturous, solemn and romantic yarns set against incredibly immersive synth backdrops that both mirror and counter the acoustic parts beautifully connoting the feeling on a mind bifurcating, spiralling and entwining in cosmic helixes. The effect is most striking in the likes of her ‘Bopoluchi’ blinder, where the sitar rings out from the eye of a steeply dark synth cyclone, or ’Stockholm Syndrome’, when her slow, air bent strings coalesce from sweeping gyroscopic synth dimensions, or when they rattle hard but harmonious like Sote’s take on traditional Persian instruments in ‘Sohni’, while ‘Love Liesse’ places her sound in the lushest romantic context, conjuring mental imagery of ancient gods, star signs, and such. less"

   "name": "Deerhunter co-founder and drummer Moses Archuleta tests his hand at electronic dance music with results landing somewhere between Eric Copeland’s scuzzy bodgers and a late ‘90s chill-out compilation. Includes guest appearances by Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, Shigeto, and Angel Deradoorian “Moon Diagrams is the solo recording project of Deerhunter co-founder and drummer Moses John Archuleta. Two years after his debut album Lifetime of Love, Archuleta returns with Trappy Bats, a mini-LP that interweaves three brilliant new Moon Diagrams tracks with radiant reworks from Shigeto, Angel Deradoorian, and Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. Trappy Bats was largely recorded in a single night as a means to process the intense intersection of Archuleta’s social, political, and personal hysteria. Having been arrested for an unknown, missed court date, Archuleta spent 24 hours in a holding cell, offering ample time to reflect on his life, the current state of the nation (the jail televisions were showing a constant feed of the then-active Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville), and the other inmates stuck inside the containment center. Upon being released the next day, Archuleta found himself suffering from a bout of insomnia and feeling the need to process everything through music. Here, Archuleta is in his freest and most grateful state, channeling the turmoil and confusion he was experiencing into an unencumbered fit of creativity. It’s pure, unadulterated escapism with an even more callous palette of sounds than before, clearly split between two different moods. The end result is an extended traipse through Saturday evening fever-dream techno, Sunday morning cigarette jazz-pop, and every blank-thought in between.” less"

Essential picks for anyone into fresh Jamaican mutations from Equiknoxx, Sikka Rhymes or STILL! Rolling on from a pair of 12”s in 2013 and the ‘Lighter Thief’ EP in 2016, the longtime Duppy Gun MC delivers hoarse bars over production from Sun Araw’s Cameron Stallones and studio supremo M. Geddes Gengras (here known as Big Flite and Velkro) who go riddim for riddim with SKRS Intl in a mutant back and forth where dancehall dissolves in a grimy bath of swinging meters and frictional textures riddled with GRM-style shrapnel and heatsick romance in 10 scenes stepping from sticky, viscous lovers rock to fractal digi-dub and manic fast-chat mutations. While comparisons with Equiknoxx, Sikka Rhymes or STILL are patently warranted, ‘Inna Duppy SKRS Soundclash’ is wildly distinguished by its intersection of operators, triangulating a madness between JA’s south coast, Vancouver and California’s West Coast. Where SKRS dematerialise the vibe in the bleepy froth of ‘DemNoBad’, Duppy Gun go sweet and treacly on ‘Turn It Up’ to test I-Jahbar’s versatility in fine style, whereas SKRS tees up something fizzier, freaky to best showcase RDL with ‘RichMiProud.’ One of the biggest highlights is the wonky- red-eyed ride of ‘Weed Patrol’, getting the best out of Stallones and Gengras’ modular digi-dub prisms, and we can almost promise the Nike vs Adidas tune ‘Ipy Ipy’ will burrow its way into a lot of faves folders, while SKRS Intl’s sizzling tilt for Buddy Don’s fast chat in ‘DuppyKilla’ makes a straight-up rabble rouser.

   "name": "Trippy cinema for the ear, placing solo piano recitals of Satie in alternately, subtly and viscerally amorphous environments - a surreal, oneiric improvisation between Maher Shalal Hash Baz mainman Tori Kudo (工藤冬里) and inventive DJ/mixtape compiler Kayo Makino, snuffled from the Japanese undergrowth by Oren Ambarchi’s Black Truffle Hatched to be played between acts at the launch of Eiko Ishibashi’s smoky gem ‘The Dreams My Bones Dreamed’, the two sides of ‘Ein Traum für Dich’ see Makino manipulate Kudo’s recordings of Satie’s 1897 work ‘Pièces froides’ and a solo piano recital with techniques ranging from subtly heady to keening, noisy and physical in their tactility and effect. Frankly it’s a fucking weird record, with one side making us feel as though somebody spiked our coffee this morning, while the other lures listeners into a sticky gooch between swaggering piano blues and seasick Japanese noise. Effortlessly smudging the line between prosaic and poetic, the duo’s A-side effort ‘Pianoise “Satie: Pièces Froides, Movement 2: Dances de Travers - No. 1 en Y Regardant À Deux Fois” is a mouthful of a title but cannily light on the ears. To a backdrop of cicadas, the piece kicks off with the sound of glass perfunctorily smashed before Kudo launches into the Satie piece, where, after a few minutes, he’s joined by a phantom set of hands which double up the piece, as though a glitch in the matrix slips time of joint and highlights the lurking dissonance of the everyday. Some may call it just wrong, but the effect is deliciously trippy to these ears, and when it’s joined by the sound of a heavy downpour outside, eyes will be slipping to half-mast and its surreal, synasethetic immersion is completed with a cinematic passage of german vocals. ‘Pianoise “2018.12.1 or Last Super Flux”’ echoes that surreality on the B-side but with a more explicit sort of psychedelic wrench. To a backdrop of sepia-steeped strings and bird calls, Tori Kudo follows his nose with featherlight piano strokes in the model of Satie for the opening minutes, before Makino chucks a digital spanner in the works with a severely down-pitched, unidentifiable song that dominates the upper registers over Kudo, sounding like an errant tab playing a YT video off a browser window, or some nuisance neighbour trying to upset the atmosphere. It’s both funny, surreal, and transfixing in the oddest, aleatoric way, and symptomatic of that space between worlds that we all occupy, maybe without realising. less"

   "name": "For the first time on vinyl; two super rare 1980-82 tapes by Two Daughters; a near-mythical, Throbbing Gristle/Industrial Records - affiliated duo who recorded glossolalic hymns, spectral percussive rituals and Bowie cut-ups in Brixton, c.1980-1982 for Nurse With Wound's United Dairies. A huge recommendation if you're into Dome, Zoviet France, O Yuki Conjugate, Panda Bear, NWW, Early Current 93 - what a find!!! Two Daughters were known to their mates as the mononymous Anthony & Paul. Anthony has since been identified as Anthony Burke, who passed away in 2004, while Paul’s identity remains a total mystery. If you take a look on discogs, the only two photographs of the pair are alongside Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter and the rest of the Industrial records gang, but there are also strange connections with Simon Fisher Turner, whose near-namesakes Deux Filles arrived a couple of years later. Two Daughters self-released a haunting, eponymous 1980 tape debut on Methane Music, and a year later they issued the ‘Kiss The Cloth / Gloria’ LP via Anthony & Paul - a sublabel of Steven Stapleton’s United Dairies, who would reissue the album on tape via his label, proper, in 1987. Aside from those tapes, no other known Two Daughters recordings exist, yet their cul-de-sac of a catalogue evidently left us with some supernaturally spellbinding material, as contained in this compilation. The first disc is given to Two Daughters self-titled 1980 debut, whose decayed cover image of two men wrapped in a billowing toga most beautifully characterises their music. In nine parts they drift from a shimmering guitar loop mantra, ‘Ladder of Souls’ to the solemn drum and glossolalic vocal procession of ‘Aaaaaar’ in a hypnagogic daze, slipping sideways along cold ceramic corridors webbed with lonely sax in ‘Return Call/We Are’, to the still-airborne waltz of ‘Sad Horizons’ and the heartbreaking hymnal poignancy of ‘So I’, while a further ‘Return Call’ sounds like a play of distant fog horns in a pea souper, and the bony rattle of ‘Drums’ runs off into something like a lo-fi pre-echo of Tanzwerk. The second LP carries all the material off their second and final release ‘Kiss The Cloth / Gloria’. It sees the first tape’s veil of ferric must lift to reveal fuller formed vocals, clearer instrumentation and electronics lathered into soporific arrangements. Side A’s ‘Kiss The Cloth’ morphs from stately string loops, flurries of wooden drums and intoxicated plainchant to pinched rhythmic electronics and lilting vocal loops equidistant to The Beach Boys and Panda Bear, culminating in a helix of lemniscate vocal and ritual drums. And then for all the audness, they open B-side ‘Gloria’ with a deeply druggy cut-up of David Bowie spliced with killer tribal percussion, before duelling with metal percussion and gamelan in the eldritch middle and locking into a fiercely meditative mix of gamelan and vocals to close. It all really feels like a true missing link between so much music we care about that it’s a no brainer for anyone curious about post-punk and experimental industrial music beyond the clichés and poster boys and girls. Aye it’s pretty much essential listening for this end of the pool. less"

Where RM’s debut album ‘Unfit’ perhaps tentatively dipped his tootsies in technoid waters after years of encrypting noise filth as Lettera 22, his follow-up for iDEAL betrays a steelier confidence and physicality to his music, manifest in a turbulent range of daring club music mutations intersected by spacious industrial percussion experiments and atmospheric pieces blessed with the romance of abandoned factories. In effect, ‘Spazi Futuri’ bridges dimensions between Maurizio Bianchi and the kind of experiments collated by the Trax label, with the modern freeform industrial of Roberto Crippa and the immersive structures divined by Donato Dozzy. In the best way, the album feels transitory, in flux, with a palpable tension between nervous energy and hypnagogia. Coming first with the chilly, pre-dawn ambience of ‘5:00’, RM follows a psychedelic techno hunch up from the toes to your nose with the driving acid churn and dissonant drip-off synth tang of ‘Società Dormiente’, followed by a killer blast of hot-stepping industrial dance music recalling recent Sam Kerridge turns gone feral with ’Sonno Drogato’, before relaxing the tension with ritual drone in the lush pocket of ’Sublimation della crisi.’ Daring to dice with dancefloor convention, RM’s rave lust resurges from a queered angle with the keening house dynamic of ‘Dittatura delle immagini’, while ‘Per natural libero’ explores industrial ballistics in cavernous space recalling Shapednoise works, and a blast of gristly rhythmic electronics departs into the acrid abstract gunk of the title cut with a post-modern industrial timelessness that’s definitively coiled tight but frayed into the machines and atmospheric remainders of RM’s music. less"

   "name": "Liquid Liquid drummer Dennis Young offers up a trio of mid/late-‘80s ambient gestures on James Duncan’s Brooklyn-based private press; Innermoods Further to a series of exquisite archival salvages dealt by S. Korea’s Daehan Electronics, ‘Portastudio Ambient Tapes’ catches Young in pursuit of new age spirits during his post-Liquids years. Using a Tascam Portastudio multitrack tape recorder and synths, he shaped a sound that echoed his ‘70s NYC minimalist forebears such as La Monte Young with a mix of wistful vocal raga and cottony arps in three parts. It’s a sound far removed from his early dance trax, including the utterly seminal ‘Cavern’ as sampled on Grandmaster Flash’s ‘White Lines’, and speaks to more esoteric conception of composition as a tool for meditation or simply daydreaming in the midst of the big apple (or wherever else it’s applied). It’s at its most spirited and richly psychedelic in the iridescent shimmer and lilting vocal cadence of ‘Hymn’, while ‘Moonlight Oasis’ follows a mellifluous instrumental hunch with twinkling keys and elliptical harmonies into the pulsating kosmiche lift of ‘Rhapsody’, which all remain exclusive to this pressing and come warmly recommended to anyone who picked up his trio for Daehan Electronics. less"

   "name": "Classy, luminous album of synth-pop and early techno-house-influenced songs from Ascetic House originals Body of Light, channelling the perky glamour of ‘80s pop and the sleaze of early ‘90s NYC dance music - think Depeche Mode meets early Joey Beltram at a Stranger Things-themed club night “Birthed from Arizona’s regaled Ascetic House collective, Body of Light is a dark synth-pop outfit comprised of young brothers Andrew and Alexander Jarson. What began as a vehicle for their exploration of noise and sound during their early teens has evolved into an established production over the last decade, as Body of Light continues to carve out their own style of complex, structured, and moving dancefloor electronics. Their music is not only individually personal, but drawn from experiences shared between the two brothers – and calls on elements of new wave, freestyle, goth, and techno to create timeless and singular tracks without fear of trend or passing fashion. On their third album Time to Kill, Body of Light refines their brand of cold and driving synth pop with a bold pallet of sounds and a focus on uncharted technique and purpose. Like the pale digital stare of the modern devices surrounding our daily lives, the album weaves stories of love and obsession in an era of technical bondage and fleeting exhilaration. Written over a period of intense and profound change, Time to Kill stands as a startling reminder of how important our existence truly is. Haunting keys, swelling pads, and punching rhythms score their work as Alex Jarson presents an alluring and romantic dialogue with confident projection. The title single “Time to Kill” kicks off the album with a merciless signature beat, complimented by distorted sample patterns against an infectious, moving bass groove that invites you to “let the memories fade.” The follow up single “Don’t Pretend” invokes sparkling nostalgia and innocence over a dark and driving beat paired with vintage electronic movements. The haunting “Dangerous”, slows the pace with its pendulum-like rhythm and ominous intonation, falling between a hopeful synth pop ballad and shadowy dirge – a slow dance for the sunrise set. Produced by Matia Simovich at Infinite Power Studios in Los Angeles and mastered by Josh Bonati, Time to Kill shines with new direction and new intention through lustrous production and innovative songwriting.” less"

   "name": "Horology 2, covering the years 1977-1978, can viewed as a prequel to the 2012 Horology boxset which scanned Adi Newton and ClockDVA's pioneering Sheffield electronics circa 1978 - 1980. The first LP features recordings by The Future - a.k.a. Newton, Martyn Ware, and Ian Craig Marsh - prior to the trio bifurcating into The Human League and ClockDVA. It includes nine songs ranging from industrial synth-pop to pulsating proto-techno and essentially covers one of the earliest and most interesting chapters in Sheffield's hugely influential electronic pop scene. However, the other four discs are by Newton solo and broach a very different section of his archive. They're abstract, amorphous recordings, scaled in length between 3 and thirteen minutes, and inspired by a spectra of esoteric elements, from psychoacoustics to early acousmatics, the occult, and infrasound. They're arguably the darkest creations you'll find from Sheffield during this era. An incredible box set and another crucial document of forgotten sounds from Vinyl on Demand. less"

The most memorable part of the series, however, is Hildur Guðnadóttir’s soundtrack, where she clearly relishes the opportunity to limn the series' portentous and overcast feel with sounds ranging from Mika Vainio-esque Geiger counter triggers to more typical cinematic strokes of her cello, as epitomised in the spine-chilling theme.

   "name": "‘Kiri Variations’ is Clark’s first self-released album on Throttle. It’s a soundtrack-like suite of neo-classical ambient styles stemming from his work on Euros Lyn’s 2018 TV miniseries. \"Mysterious and morbidly beautiful pieces driven by piano, harpsichord, clarinet, strings, electronics and voice are interspersed with fabulously unusual and highly original curveballs: Odd-in-a-brilliant-way, the faux naïve ‘Kiri’s Glee’, evokes traveling minstrels of yore accidentally eating the wrong ‘shrooms, and ‘Coffin Knocker’ has diffracted psych feel, like David Axelrod’s work with the Electric Prunes, but chopped, screwed and scorched. ‘Forebode Knocker’ is darkly funky, like the kind of lost diggers’ nugget unearthed and sampled by RZA, whilst the sonically-perfect ‘Primary Pluck’ unfurls exquisitely, swaying slowly ever forward like a funeral march. ‘Cannibal Homecoming’ is nothing short of Clark’s most song-based composition ever, featuring augmented human voice as evident elsewhere and also a fully-fledged vocal sung by him. ‘Kiri Variations’ started life as the score to the BAFTA-nominated TV program ‘Kiri’, but only a small (and highly effective) portion of the music recorded was used – intentionally sparingly – by director Euros Lyn. That first incarnation has since grown and morphed intosomething entirely of its own being; a proper artist album. “In addition to my usual methods of controlled randomness and tangential ideas, the TV commission was a prominent spark for new approaches. It’s a great balancing contrast with the solipsistic studio album”, Clark explains. The record allows simplicity and playfulness to shine through: “It’s a skeleton of an album, reduced to bare essentials, although it started out rather dense - the thing that takes time is making it succinct.\"explains Clark. “Certain parts are also what you could call anti muso – for example the recorder on ‘Kiri’s Glee’ is totally out of tune – but it sounds so colourful. I can’t resist the primary paint of acoustic instruments; it’s an antidote to frictionless digital music.\" less"

   "name": "Given the post-apocalyptic context of The Road you might be surprised by how often its Nick Cave and Warren Ellis soundtrack verges on unblemished optimism and warmth. Applying themselves to the score for the cinematic interpretation of the Pulitzer-winning Cormac McCarthy novel the two Bad Seeds and Grinderman veterans do well to avoid wallowing in gloom for the entire stretch. The compositions gathered for this album release certainly cater to the mournful potential of the project, but you'll encounter uncynical hopefulness permeating pieces like 'The Church', 'Home' and 'The Bath', and a sophisticated, inconclusive mood cast over others such as 'Storytime' and 'Memory'. There are however one or two choice moments of abject terror. 'Cannibals' gives away its horrific intentions with its title, but the blood-curdling urgency and gutsy, chaotic rhythms prove to be impressively hair-raising. Elsewhere, 'The House' offers discordant menace and violin strangling with a side-order of blood-curdling electronic distortion. At the other extreme you're greeted by ridiculously emotive pieces like 'The Mother', which jostles alongside Max Richter and Sigur Ros in the sentimentality stakes. Listening to achingly sad and beautiful music by Cave and Ellis isn't quite the same experience as it might have been had other musicians authored it: the fact that you know what dark musical deeds these two are capable of tints the most tearjerking passages with a little extra gravitas. String and piano arrangements make up the bulk of the instrumentation here, but key to the success of this project is that unlike so many orchestral film scores this sounds like a bonafide album, retaining the personalities of the two composers and central performers. less"

   "name": "Thom Yorke yields his most enjoyable solo record yet with ‘Anima’, shapeshifting back into avant-pop mode after last year’s OST for the remake of cult horror ‘Suspiria’. Bridging experimental pop songwriting and electronic dance music dimensions, Yorke and his trusty studio partner Nigel Godrich yet again sneak classy contemporary rhythms and ideas into the diet of traditional songwriting. The nine songs of ‘Anima’ also find Yorke porous to a modern Afro-Latinate phase shift, embracing slinky permutations of dembow tresillo patterns and needle-point electroid 2-step in an ever finer balance of melodic conventions and the inexorable thrills of electronic music. Most crucially, acknowledging those rhythmic accents that come from beyond mostly white, western rhythmic hegemony. That slinky drive and flow gives the album an effortless appeal, carrying it from the pendulous, schizoid vocals of ‘Traffic’, thru the writhing ‘Twist’, before catching Yorke at his most endearingly scuffed, bluesy and soulful with ‘I Am A Very Rude Person.’ The halfway point is marked by a real future classic in his catalogue with ‘Not The News’ laying a fine seam of Autechrian reggaeton and phasing riffs for some of his patented, dramatic flourishes, while the in-the-pocket shuffle of ‘Impossible Knots’ highlights a canny link with Scritti Politti’s early ‘80s balance of post-punk and new pop, before ‘Runwayaway’ feels pulled between psychy Tuareg desert blues, krautrock, lilting eldritch folk and AFXian acid in a way that perhaps only Yorke could nail quite like this. 'Dawn Chorus', perhaps the album's centrepoint, places the vocal high and up front in the mix for an open encounter with the sublime. There's nothing really to it - like all the best songs. less"

   "name": "'Returnal' is the fourth LP from the Boston/New York based synth dreamer, Oneohtrix Point Never. Last year's 'Drifts' set was a compendium of his previous - and very hard-to-come-by - albums for labels including No Fun, Arbor and Gneiss Things and was a clear favourite for many in 2009, held in high regard by the Wire magazine, and cherished dearly by anyone in its possession. OPN's hypnagogically-charged body of work is a dense fog of references, from beat driven edits on the 'Memory Vague' mini-album recollecting DJ Screw's slowcore psychedelia, to privately intimate sci-fi vistas of 'Russian Mind' harking back to synth-whizz J.D Emmanuel. Mego's Peter Rehberg obviously sensed the appeal of this mixture, putting together OPN's most developed and mindblowing work for this brand new album, aligning an exceptional potential within the contemporary sonic landscape. For us, with the exception of few others, we've not really come across an artist whose music has so profoundly affected us in a very long time. Dare we say it...? Since Burial. This is an essential purchase for lovers of Fever Ray, Popol Vuh, Klaus Schulze, Autechre, Aphex Twin or Jan Hammer. less"

   "name": "Inspired, wholly unexpected collaboration between legendary singer songwriter Mark Lanegan and Ecstatic maverick Alessio Natalizia aka Not Waving - a timeless, modernist fusion of barrel-aged narratives and diverse, experimental backdrops, RIYL Scott Walker, Conny Plank & Moebius, David Sylvian... Following Not Waving’s stellar recent recordings with Jim O’Rourke, Colin Potter & Jay Glass Dubs, ‘Downwelling’ finds him in a striking Pas de deux with alt. rock god Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees, QOTSA). It’s one of those rare link-ups that truly transcends the sum of its parts, with Not Waving’s rolling range of nuanced electronics acting as backdrops for Lanegan’s smoky barritone storytelling. Delivered in a husky but pliable voice that has come to define the American alternative rock scene since the early ‘90s, Lanegan inhabits the songs with a reserved presence that has served him well for decades, but which has never been heard in quite this context. Pairing music recorded by Natalizia between London, Italy, and Paris over the past five years, with vocals recorded by Lanegan in LA, the duo arrive at dreamy non-place that’s not defined by geography or time. Instead the album offers a timeless insight into human behaviour, as reflected in the sleeve art details from the ‘Lights of Canopus’, a Persian version of the ancient Indian book of animal fables, the ‘Panchatantra.’ Thanks to Lanegan’s classically dusty tone - famously described as being “scratchy as a three day beard yet as supple as moccasin leather” - and the breadth of Not Waving’s production, the results draw listeners deep into the artists’ shared plane of world-weary but quietly hopeful conception, emphasising the power of closeness and empathy. Their songs come on like waves lapping a shore that’s ever-shifting, ever the same. This cycle is epitomised on the opener, ’Signifying The End’ with Lanegan’s raspy tone met by honeyed synths, before scaling the nocturnal heights of ‘City Of Sin’ and coolly channeling Suicide in ‘Burn Out Babylon.’ The waters calm again for ‘Persimmon Tree’ suitably set to harp-like arps, while the deathly croon and impending throb of ‘Murder In Fugue’ comes to rest in the serene resolution of ‘The Broken Man’ in a manner that’s entirely modernist but speaks to eons of human emotion. Echoing everything from latter-days Scott Walker to David Sylvian at his most strung out, and even the odd energy of Moebius, Conny Plank & Mayo Thompson’s ‘Ludwig’s Law’ album, or the arcane creak of John Duncan’s ‘Bitter Earth’, Natalizia & Lanegan’s efforts will surely realign listeners presumptions of both artists and place them in a category all of their own. less"

Artilect straps up the strong back juggernaut ‘A Message’ with mentasms right out of a ’96 era Doc Scott killer, while Samurai bossman DJ Presha meets Seattle’s Homemade Weapons for the bolshy trample and clambering drums of ‘The Claw’.

The first in a series of TVV’s previously unreleased ‘90s recordings “TV Victor was one of the first artists of Tresor Records where he became legendary with several of his ambient and trance productions including Trance Garden 1-3 and Trancecology Chapter 1. In 1989, he launched his first solo project: Moondance – The Magic Sound of the Moon, where he lay foundations for later explorations with experimental sounds fused with pop elements and anticipated an ambient excursion to be had in the future. In the following decades TV Victor created impressive solo works that traversed between ambient and trance, he collaborated with artists like Moritz v. Oswald, Max Loderbauer, Ari Benjamin Meyers, Paul Browse and Tobias Freud. Contrary to common mainstream tendencies he created a very unique interpretation of both genres. In recent years Victor has concentrated on creating experimental and abstract sonic spaces for escaping reality, spaces that live through the imagination of the listener. Each piece, a segment of a larger musical movement; stands alone to create new sonic continuums. Otherworldy music that is in its own sphere. 30 years after the release of Moondance and 50 years after the first landing, Lullabies For Insomniacs revisit TV Victor’s musical roots with ‘Back To The Moon’. The previously unreleased works were carefully selected from his vaults and restored by Berlin based engineer Brett Olke (B Ashra), the album offers a glimpse into the future by creating a soundtrack for mankind’s settlement of beyond in a conceivable hereafter.” less"

Rendez-Vous Contemporains de Saint-Merry is Demdike at their most contemplative and experimental, tempering quietly euphoric strings with field recorded mayhem and frayed percussion scattered across the stereo field. From there; raw materials disassembled and rewired, tape spools unwound, whispers amplified in the echo chamber, concrète and sacred music re-coded into a collision of disorientating menace and bliss. There are also diversions; the arpeggiated coda towards the end of the first side, smudged bassdrums and vocal hooks appearing on side B like a mad apparition, and then brushed jazz cymbals unwinding into a fizzing tremor of collapsed sound, ending the tape off like the dust-settling aftermath of some unnatural calamity, re-played in slow motion. less"

This plate strongly backs up that argument with surefire belters by The Bees and Little Big Man, whose original copies trade for understandably high amounts on the 2nd hand market.

Working with his re-imagined version of Daphne Oram’s uncompleted “Mini Oramics” machine - a slightly less unwieldy version of her drawing/light-to-sound interface for music making - which he finished in 2016, Tom harnesses its bleeps and whistles to palpitating bass drums owing to modern dance music, dreaming of what Daphne might have come up with if, as rumours imply, she really was at the first Shoom party. Diffracting influences ranging from Ghanaian drum choir music to the cellular rhythms of Steve Reich and ritual trance thru his Mini Oramics machine, Richards scries a sort of alternative historical timeline where Daphne toured West Africa in the ’80s and intersected the NYC downtown minimalists, forging his own sort of home listening techno in the process. less"
