The title track ‘She’s A Witch (Tikoloshi)’ is a real standout balancing super rugged bassline with those signature, pained vocal harmonies, singing lyrics about a ’Tikoloshi’, the mischievous creature of Zulu folklore (usually a man) who is blamed for all manner of mysterious happenings at night. Next to the more uptempo and slicker glyde of the DJ-ready ‘Hlabalaza’, this one’s a bit of a must. less"

Produced by a range of grime’s big guns, from Danny Weed and Terror Danjah to Target, Maniac and Bless Beats, it also features a strong roll call of guest MC’s such as Wiley, Dot Rotten, Flowdan and Ghetts, who clearly cosigned that the 15 year old was one to watch, and even work with. Nearly a decade later, the album is patently future-proofed by its colourful production palette, taking in shades of UKF and UKG beside the grime standards, and Maxsta’s animated delivery, which would later light up the killer ‘100 Problems’ 12” with Maniac and Boothroyd in 2015. less"

   "name": "Crushingly dark and ominous avant-classical nocturnal scapes from Tehran-based Siavash Amini, marking his debut with Lawrence English’s Room 40. Amini’s work in ‘Serus’ is often scowlingly serious, but not without its moments of spacious, harmonic relief that bring the album’s underlying themes about sleep and dreams to life in suitably heavy-lidded, edge of nightmare fashion. One to be filed in your New Iranian Electronics folder, and another strong release in what's proving to be a vintage year for Room 40. ““Every night is two nights, according to Maurice Blanchot. The night the body spends in sleep is not the same as the night the dreamer spends in dreams. The sleeping body may lie under the stars, and the dreamer may dream of the stars—even of a journey to the stars—but the night of the dream is a night without stars.” From Siavash: The Idea of this album, when I first started drafting it, was to continue what struck me as very interesting yet simple idea; night. I became interested in different definitions of what night is, our perception of it and what night means physically to us as well as symbolically. I came across the idea of ‘other night’ described by Maurice Blanchot, during my research. It started me recognising night as something we experience as ‘the night of sleep’; it is night that we resist in sleep, by way of dreaming. Things became more interesting for me during many nights of not sleeping and intoxication, and an eventual nervous breakdown. This experience, culminating in me spending three days in ICU, gave me pause to think about Blanchot’s words. Slipping in and out of consciousness my mind, which had already experienced a blurring of what one might call the ‘other night’ and the night itself, by being in half sleep most of the time. I felt myself far way from all my surroundings and at the same time being very attentive to some details in the objects around me. It was as if my body and mind where in an in-between state. I can only describe this as being distant or more precisely being in the dark. Objects and people showed themselves out of proportion and mostly dim. A feeling to describe this sensation, the word for which I only came across later, is ‘Serus’. There was a sense of repetition and familiarity in some feelings and emotions that I had towards some objects like sensing I knew them but not exactly from where or when. It was as if my body was resisting sleep and my sleepy mind was resisting being awake, only to dream of another type of the world that I could be awake in.” less"

The current show may not be as dazzling as the early ones, but it’s still a polished hard diamond of a thing, presenting mutated versions of early anthems and new songs alike, with a particular leaning towards Afro-Latinate percussion that lets you know you’re not at another clunky EDM or rock gig, as bigger staged shows often play up to. That rhythm-driven approach is perfectly characterised in the newly slinky swerve of ‘When I Grow Up’ and the rude swang of ‘Triangle Walks’ from her self-titled debut, along with a trilling take on ‘If I Had A Heart’ that hits the mark dead on. However, the majority of material is from 2017’s ‘Plunge’, including a spellbinding version of the fetish pop beauty ‘Mustn’t Hurry’, and a carnival-ready take on the Nídia-produced ‘Idk About You’, and a thrillingly sharp and sexy spin of ‘Wanna Sip’ that we remember slicing thru the crowd at their Manchester show. less"

Mark Pritchard meanwhile swaps the original drums out entirely for a sort of squashed, live-sounding nyabighi or talking drum sounds underlaid with massive subs to recalling Mark Ernestus’ Ndagga Rhythm Force gone maudlin, while Clark brings up the rear with a weird glam rock swagger.

   "name": "This is lovely - Baltimore’s Ami Dang navigates alternately lush, ecstatic and meditative fusions of East and West with spellbinding arrangements of sitar, voice and kosmiche electronics. Trust this is no ersatz ethnomusicology but a naturally visionary and well-skooled flight of imagination - mind-boggling new expansions of classical Indian music augmented with stunning synthwork. RIYL SOTE’s ‘Parallel Persia’ , Charanjit Singh’s ’Synthesizing: Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat’ Where too many artists have paid lip service to fusing classical Indian music traditions with modern music, Ami Dang authentically yields something thrilling, entrancing and genuinely unique with ‘Parted Plains.’ Interpreting South Asian and Middle Eastern folktales - the four tragic romances of Punjab, Sohni Mahiwal, Sassi Punnun, Heer Ranjha, and Mirza Sahiba; Flora Annie Steel’s Tales of the Punjab: Folklore of India, and selected stories from One Thousand and One Nights - Ami presents a new chapter of Indian fusion music that firmly speaks to a modern, hemisphere-harmonising synthesis of East and West, contemporary and traditional. In Ami’s hands those ancient tales live on in the tactile, narrative expression of her music. The plangent plucks of sitar lyrically take centre stage, reeling off a range of rapturous, solemn and romantic yarns set against incredibly immersive synth backdrops that both mirror and counter the acoustic parts beautifully connoting the feeling on a mind bifurcating, spiralling and entwining in cosmic helixes. The effect is most striking in the likes of her ‘Bopoluchi’ blinder, where the sitar rings out from the eye of a steeply dark synth cyclone, or ’Stockholm Syndrome’, when her slow, air bent strings coalesce from sweeping gyroscopic synth dimensions, or when they rattle hard but harmonious like Sote’s take on traditional Persian instruments in ‘Sohni’, while ‘Love Liesse’ places her sound in the lushest romantic context, conjuring mental imagery of ancient gods, star signs, and such. less"

   "name": "Deerhunter co-founder and drummer Moses Archuleta tests his hand at electronic dance music with results landing somewhere between Eric Copeland’s scuzzy bodgers and a late ‘90s chill-out compilation. Includes guest appearances by Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, Shigeto, and Angel Deradoorian “Moon Diagrams is the solo recording project of Deerhunter co-founder and drummer Moses John Archuleta. Two years after his debut album Lifetime of Love, Archuleta returns with Trappy Bats, a mini-LP that interweaves three brilliant new Moon Diagrams tracks with radiant reworks from Shigeto, Angel Deradoorian, and Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. Trappy Bats was largely recorded in a single night as a means to process the intense intersection of Archuleta’s social, political, and personal hysteria. Having been arrested for an unknown, missed court date, Archuleta spent 24 hours in a holding cell, offering ample time to reflect on his life, the current state of the nation (the jail televisions were showing a constant feed of the then-active Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville), and the other inmates stuck inside the containment center. Upon being released the next day, Archuleta found himself suffering from a bout of insomnia and feeling the need to process everything through music. Here, Archuleta is in his freest and most grateful state, channeling the turmoil and confusion he was experiencing into an unencumbered fit of creativity. It’s pure, unadulterated escapism with an even more callous palette of sounds than before, clearly split between two different moods. The end result is an extended traipse through Saturday evening fever-dream techno, Sunday morning cigarette jazz-pop, and every blank-thought in between.” less"

Essential picks for anyone into fresh Jamaican mutations from Equiknoxx, Sikka Rhymes or STILL! Rolling on from a pair of 12”s in 2013 and the ‘Lighter Thief’ EP in 2016, the longtime Duppy Gun MC delivers hoarse bars over production from Sun Araw’s Cameron Stallones and studio supremo M. Geddes Gengras (here known as Big Flite and Velkro) who go riddim for riddim with SKRS Intl in a mutant back and forth where dancehall dissolves in a grimy bath of swinging meters and frictional textures riddled with GRM-style shrapnel and heatsick romance in 10 scenes stepping from sticky, viscous lovers rock to fractal digi-dub and manic fast-chat mutations. While comparisons with Equiknoxx, Sikka Rhymes or STILL are patently warranted, ‘Inna Duppy SKRS Soundclash’ is wildly distinguished by its intersection of operators, triangulating a madness between JA’s south coast, Vancouver and California’s West Coast. Where SKRS dematerialise the vibe in the bleepy froth of ‘DemNoBad’, Duppy Gun go sweet and treacly on ‘Turn It Up’ to test I-Jahbar’s versatility in fine style, whereas SKRS tees up something fizzier, freaky to best showcase RDL with ‘RichMiProud.’ One of the biggest highlights is the wonky- red-eyed ride of ‘Weed Patrol’, getting the best out of Stallones and Gengras’ modular digi-dub prisms, and we can almost promise the Nike vs Adidas tune ‘Ipy Ipy’ will burrow its way into a lot of faves folders, while SKRS Intl’s sizzling tilt for Buddy Don’s fast chat in ‘DuppyKilla’ makes a straight-up rabble rouser.

   "name": "Trippy cinema for the ear, placing solo piano recitals of Satie in alternately, subtly and viscerally amorphous environments - a surreal, oneiric improvisation between Maher Shalal Hash Baz mainman Tori Kudo (工藤冬里) and inventive DJ/mixtape compiler Kayo Makino, snuffled from the Japanese undergrowth by Oren Ambarchi’s Black Truffle Hatched to be played between acts at the launch of Eiko Ishibashi’s smoky gem ‘The Dreams My Bones Dreamed’, the two sides of ‘Ein Traum für Dich’ see Makino manipulate Kudo’s recordings of Satie’s 1897 work ‘Pièces froides’ and a solo piano recital with techniques ranging from subtly heady to keening, noisy and physical in their tactility and effect. Frankly it’s a fucking weird record, with one side making us feel as though somebody spiked our coffee this morning, while the other lures listeners into a sticky gooch between swaggering piano blues and seasick Japanese noise. Effortlessly smudging the line between prosaic and poetic, the duo’s A-side effort ‘Pianoise “Satie: Pièces Froides, Movement 2: Dances de Travers - No. 1 en Y Regardant À Deux Fois” is a mouthful of a title but cannily light on the ears. To a backdrop of cicadas, the piece kicks off with the sound of glass perfunctorily smashed before Kudo launches into the Satie piece, where, after a few minutes, he’s joined by a phantom set of hands which double up the piece, as though a glitch in the matrix slips time of joint and highlights the lurking dissonance of the everyday. Some may call it just wrong, but the effect is deliciously trippy to these ears, and when it’s joined by the sound of a heavy downpour outside, eyes will be slipping to half-mast and its surreal, synasethetic immersion is completed with a cinematic passage of german vocals. ‘Pianoise “2018.12.1 or Last Super Flux”’ echoes that surreality on the B-side but with a more explicit sort of psychedelic wrench. To a backdrop of sepia-steeped strings and bird calls, Tori Kudo follows his nose with featherlight piano strokes in the model of Satie for the opening minutes, before Makino chucks a digital spanner in the works with a severely down-pitched, unidentifiable song that dominates the upper registers over Kudo, sounding like an errant tab playing a YT video off a browser window, or some nuisance neighbour trying to upset the atmosphere. It’s both funny, surreal, and transfixing in the oddest, aleatoric way, and symptomatic of that space between worlds that we all occupy, maybe without realising. less"

   "name": "For the first time on vinyl; two super rare 1980-82 tapes by Two Daughters; a near-mythical, Throbbing Gristle/Industrial Records - affiliated duo who recorded glossolalic hymns, spectral percussive rituals and Bowie cut-ups in Brixton, c.1980-1982 for Nurse With Wound's United Dairies. A huge recommendation if you're into Dome, Zoviet France, O Yuki Conjugate, Panda Bear, NWW, Early Current 93 - what a find!!! Two Daughters were known to their mates as the mononymous Anthony & Paul. Anthony has since been identified as Anthony Burke, who passed away in 2004, while Paul’s identity remains a total mystery. If you take a look on discogs, the only two photographs of the pair are alongside Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter and the rest of the Industrial records gang, but there are also strange connections with Simon Fisher Turner, whose near-namesakes Deux Filles arrived a couple of years later. Two Daughters self-released a haunting, eponymous 1980 tape debut on Methane Music, and a year later they issued the ‘Kiss The Cloth / Gloria’ LP via Anthony & Paul - a sublabel of Steven Stapleton’s United Dairies, who would reissue the album on tape via his label, proper, in 1987. Aside from those tapes, no other known Two Daughters recordings exist, yet their cul-de-sac of a catalogue evidently left us with some supernaturally spellbinding material, as contained in this compilation. The first disc is given to Two Daughters self-titled 1980 debut, whose decayed cover image of two men wrapped in a billowing toga most beautifully characterises their music. In nine parts they drift from a shimmering guitar loop mantra, ‘Ladder of Souls’ to the solemn drum and glossolalic vocal procession of ‘Aaaaaar’ in a hypnagogic daze, slipping sideways along cold ceramic corridors webbed with lonely sax in ‘Return Call/We Are’, to the still-airborne waltz of ‘Sad Horizons’ and the heartbreaking hymnal poignancy of ‘So I’, while a further ‘Return Call’ sounds like a play of distant fog horns in a pea souper, and the bony rattle of ‘Drums’ runs off into something like a lo-fi pre-echo of Tanzwerk. The second LP carries all the material off their second and final release ‘Kiss The Cloth / Gloria’. It sees the first tape’s veil of ferric must lift to reveal fuller formed vocals, clearer instrumentation and electronics lathered into soporific arrangements. Side A’s ‘Kiss The Cloth’ morphs from stately string loops, flurries of wooden drums and intoxicated plainchant to pinched rhythmic electronics and lilting vocal loops equidistant to The Beach Boys and Panda Bear, culminating in a helix of lemniscate vocal and ritual drums. And then for all the audness, they open B-side ‘Gloria’ with a deeply druggy cut-up of David Bowie spliced with killer tribal percussion, before duelling with metal percussion and gamelan in the eldritch middle and locking into a fiercely meditative mix of gamelan and vocals to close. It all really feels like a true missing link between so much music we care about that it’s a no brainer for anyone curious about post-punk and experimental industrial music beyond the clichés and poster boys and girls. Aye it’s pretty much essential listening for this end of the pool. less"

Where RM’s debut album ‘Unfit’ perhaps tentatively dipped his tootsies in technoid waters after years of encrypting noise filth as Lettera 22, his follow-up for iDEAL betrays a steelier confidence and physicality to his music, manifest in a turbulent range of daring club music mutations intersected by spacious industrial percussion experiments and atmospheric pieces blessed with the romance of abandoned factories. In effect, ‘Spazi Futuri’ bridges dimensions between Maurizio Bianchi and the kind of experiments collated by the Trax label, with the modern freeform industrial of Roberto Crippa and the immersive structures divined by Donato Dozzy. In the best way, the album feels transitory, in flux, with a palpable tension between nervous energy and hypnagogia. Coming first with the chilly, pre-dawn ambience of ‘5:00’, RM follows a psychedelic techno hunch up from the toes to your nose with the driving acid churn and dissonant drip-off synth tang of ‘Società Dormiente’, followed by a killer blast of hot-stepping industrial dance music recalling recent Sam Kerridge turns gone feral with ’Sonno Drogato’, before relaxing the tension with ritual drone in the lush pocket of ’Sublimation della crisi.’ Daring to dice with dancefloor convention, RM’s rave lust resurges from a queered angle with the keening house dynamic of ‘Dittatura delle immagini’, while ‘Per natural libero’ explores industrial ballistics in cavernous space recalling Shapednoise works, and a blast of gristly rhythmic electronics departs into the acrid abstract gunk of the title cut with a post-modern industrial timelessness that’s definitively coiled tight but frayed into the machines and atmospheric remainders of RM’s music. less"

Korea’s Daehan Electronics, ‘Portastudio Ambient Tapes’ catches Young in pursuit of new age spirits during his post-Liquids years. Using a Tascam Portastudio multitrack tape recorder and synths, he shaped a sound that echoed his ‘70s NYC minimalist forebears such as La Monte Young with a mix of wistful vocal raga and cottony arps in three parts. It’s a sound far removed from his early dance trax, including the utterly seminal ‘Cavern’ as sampled on Grandmaster Flash’s ‘White Lines’, and speaks to more esoteric conception of composition as a tool for meditation or simply daydreaming in the midst of the big apple (or wherever else it’s applied). It’s at its most spirited and richly psychedelic in the iridescent shimmer and lilting vocal cadence of ‘Hymn’, while ‘Moonlight Oasis’ follows a mellifluous instrumental hunch with twinkling keys and elliptical harmonies into the pulsating kosmiche lift of ‘Rhapsody’, which all remain exclusive to this pressing and come warmly recommended to anyone who picked up his trio for Daehan Electronics. less"

   "name": "Classy, luminous album of synth-pop and early techno-house-influenced songs from Ascetic House originals Body of Light, channelling the perky glamour of ‘80s pop and the sleaze of early ‘90s NYC dance music - think Depeche Mode meets early Joey Beltram at a Stranger Things-themed club night “Birthed from Arizona’s regaled Ascetic House collective, Body of Light is a dark synth-pop outfit comprised of young brothers Andrew and Alexander Jarson. What began as a vehicle for their exploration of noise and sound during their early teens has evolved into an established production over the last decade, as Body of Light continues to carve out their own style of complex, structured, and moving dancefloor electronics. Their music is not only individually personal, but drawn from experiences shared between the two brothers – and calls on elements of new wave, freestyle, goth, and techno to create timeless and singular tracks without fear of trend or passing fashion. On their third album Time to Kill, Body of Light refines their brand of cold and driving synth pop with a bold pallet of sounds and a focus on uncharted technique and purpose. Like the pale digital stare of the modern devices surrounding our daily lives, the album weaves stories of love and obsession in an era of technical bondage and fleeting exhilaration. Written over a period of intense and profound change, Time to Kill stands as a startling reminder of how important our existence truly is. Haunting keys, swelling pads, and punching rhythms score their work as Alex Jarson presents an alluring and romantic dialogue with confident projection. The title single “Time to Kill” kicks off the album with a merciless signature beat, complimented by distorted sample patterns against an infectious, moving bass groove that invites you to “let the memories fade.” The follow up single “Don’t Pretend” invokes sparkling nostalgia and innocence over a dark and driving beat paired with vintage electronic movements. The haunting “Dangerous”, slows the pace with its pendulum-like rhythm and ominous intonation, falling between a hopeful synth pop ballad and shadowy dirge – a slow dance for the sunrise set. Produced by Matia Simovich at Infinite Power Studios in Los Angeles and mastered by Josh Bonati, Time to Kill shines with new direction and new intention through lustrous production and innovative songwriting.” less"

   "name": "Horology 2, covering the years 1977-1978, can viewed as a prequel to the 2012 Horology boxset which scanned Adi Newton and ClockDVA's pioneering Sheffield electronics circa 1978 - 1980. The first LP features recordings by The Future - a.k.a. Newton, Martyn Ware, and Ian Craig Marsh - prior to the trio bifurcating into The Human League and ClockDVA. It includes nine songs ranging from industrial synth-pop to pulsating proto-techno and essentially covers one of the earliest and most interesting chapters in Sheffield's hugely influential electronic pop scene. However, the other four discs are by Newton solo and broach a very different section of his archive. They're abstract, amorphous recordings, scaled in length between 3 and thirteen minutes, and inspired by a spectra of esoteric elements, from psychoacoustics to early acousmatics, the occult, and infrasound. They're arguably the darkest creations you'll find from Sheffield during this era. An incredible box set and another crucial document of forgotten sounds from Vinyl on Demand. less"

   "name": "‘Kiri Variations’ is Clark’s first self-released album on Throttle. It’s a soundtrack-like suite of neo-classical ambient styles stemming from his work on Euros Lyn’s 2018 TV miniseries. \"Mysterious and morbidly beautiful pieces driven by piano, harpsichord, clarinet, strings, electronics and voice are interspersed with fabulously unusual and highly original curveballs: Odd-in-a-brilliant-way, the faux naïve ‘Kiri’s Glee’, evokes traveling minstrels of yore accidentally eating the wrong ‘shrooms, and ‘Coffin Knocker’ has diffracted psych feel, like David Axelrod’s work with the Electric Prunes, but chopped, screwed and scorched. ‘Forebode Knocker’ is darkly funky, like the kind of lost diggers’ nugget unearthed and sampled by RZA, whilst the sonically-perfect ‘Primary Pluck’ unfurls exquisitely, swaying slowly ever forward like a funeral march. ‘Cannibal Homecoming’ is nothing short of Clark’s most song-based composition ever, featuring augmented human voice as evident elsewhere and also a fully-fledged vocal sung by him. ‘Kiri Variations’ started life as the score to the BAFTA-nominated TV program ‘Kiri’, but only a small (and highly effective) portion of the music recorded was used – intentionally sparingly – by director Euros Lyn. That first incarnation has since grown and morphed intosomething entirely of its own being; a proper artist album. “In addition to my usual methods of controlled randomness and tangential ideas, the TV commission was a prominent spark for new approaches. It’s a great balancing contrast with the solipsistic studio album”, Clark explains. The record allows simplicity and playfulness to shine through: “It’s a skeleton of an album, reduced to bare essentials, although it started out rather dense - the thing that takes time is making it succinct.\"explains Clark. “Certain parts are also what you could call anti muso – for example the recorder on ‘Kiri’s Glee’ is totally out of tune – but it sounds so colourful. I can’t resist the primary paint of acoustic instruments; it’s an antidote to frictionless digital music.\" less"

   "name": "Given the post-apocalyptic context of The Road you might be surprised by how often its Nick Cave and Warren Ellis soundtrack verges on unblemished optimism and warmth. Applying themselves to the score for the cinematic interpretation of the Pulitzer-winning Cormac McCarthy novel the two Bad Seeds and Grinderman veterans do well to avoid wallowing in gloom for the entire stretch. The compositions gathered for this album release certainly cater to the mournful potential of the project, but you'll encounter uncynical hopefulness permeating pieces like 'The Church', 'Home' and 'The Bath', and a sophisticated, inconclusive mood cast over others such as 'Storytime' and 'Memory'. There are however one or two choice moments of abject terror. 'Cannibals' gives away its horrific intentions with its title, but the blood-curdling urgency and gutsy, chaotic rhythms prove to be impressively hair-raising. Elsewhere, 'The House' offers discordant menace and violin strangling with a side-order of blood-curdling electronic distortion. At the other extreme you're greeted by ridiculously emotive pieces like 'The Mother', which jostles alongside Max Richter and Sigur Ros in the sentimentality stakes. Listening to achingly sad and beautiful music by Cave and Ellis isn't quite the same experience as it might have been had other musicians authored it: the fact that you know what dark musical deeds these two are capable of tints the most tearjerking passages with a little extra gravitas. String and piano arrangements make up the bulk of the instrumentation here, but key to the success of this project is that unlike so many orchestral film scores this sounds like a bonafide album, retaining the personalities of the two composers and central performers. less"

   "name": "Thom Yorke yields his most enjoyable solo record yet with ‘Anima’, shapeshifting back into avant-pop mode after last year’s OST for the remake of cult horror ‘Suspiria’. Bridging experimental pop songwriting and electronic dance music dimensions, Yorke and his trusty studio partner Nigel Godrich yet again sneak classy contemporary rhythms and ideas into the diet of traditional songwriting. The nine songs of ‘Anima’ also find Yorke porous to a modern Afro-Latinate phase shift, embracing slinky permutations of dembow tresillo patterns and needle-point electroid 2-step in an ever finer balance of melodic conventions and the inexorable thrills of electronic music. Most crucially, acknowledging those rhythmic accents that come from beyond mostly white, western rhythmic hegemony. That slinky drive and flow gives the album an effortless appeal, carrying it from the pendulous, schizoid vocals of ‘Traffic’, thru the writhing ‘Twist’, before catching Yorke at his most endearingly scuffed, bluesy and soulful with ‘I Am A Very Rude Person.’ The halfway point is marked by a real future classic in his catalogue with ‘Not The News’ laying a fine seam of Autechrian reggaeton and phasing riffs for some of his patented, dramatic flourishes, while the in-the-pocket shuffle of ‘Impossible Knots’ highlights a canny link with Scritti Politti’s early ‘80s balance of post-punk and new pop, before ‘Runwayaway’ feels pulled between psychy Tuareg desert blues, krautrock, lilting eldritch folk and AFXian acid in a way that perhaps only Yorke could nail quite like this. 'Dawn Chorus', perhaps the album's centrepoint, places the vocal high and up front in the mix for an open encounter with the sublime. There's nothing really to it - like all the best songs. less"

Last year's 'Drifts' set was a compendium of his previous - and very hard-to-come-by - albums for labels including No Fun, Arbor and Gneiss Things and was a clear favourite for many in 2009, held in high regard by the Wire magazine, and cherished dearly by anyone in its possession. OPN's hypnagogically-charged body of work is a dense fog of references, from beat driven edits on the 'Memory Vague' mini-album recollecting DJ Screw's slowcore psychedelia, to privately intimate sci-fi vistas of 'Russian Mind' harking back to synth-whizz J.D Emmanuel. Mego's Peter Rehberg obviously sensed the appeal of this mixture, putting together OPN's most developed and mindblowing work for this brand new album, aligning an exceptional potential within the contemporary sonic landscape.

   "name": "Inspired, wholly unexpected collaboration between legendary singer songwriter Mark Lanegan and Ecstatic maverick Alessio Natalizia aka Not Waving - a timeless, modernist fusion of barrel-aged narratives and diverse, experimental backdrops, RIYL Scott Walker, Conny Plank & Moebius, David Sylvian... Following Not Waving’s stellar recent recordings with Jim O’Rourke, Colin Potter & Jay Glass Dubs, ‘Downwelling’ finds him in a striking Pas de deux with alt. rock god Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees, QOTSA). It’s one of those rare link-ups that truly transcends the sum of its parts, with Not Waving’s rolling range of nuanced electronics acting as backdrops for Lanegan’s smoky barritone storytelling. Delivered in a husky but pliable voice that has come to define the American alternative rock scene since the early ‘90s, Lanegan inhabits the songs with a reserved presence that has served him well for decades, but which has never been heard in quite this context. Pairing music recorded by Natalizia between London, Italy, and Paris over the past five years, with vocals recorded by Lanegan in LA, the duo arrive at dreamy non-place that’s not defined by geography or time. Instead the album offers a timeless insight into human behaviour, as reflected in the sleeve art details from the ‘Lights of Canopus’, a Persian version of the ancient Indian book of animal fables, the ‘Panchatantra.’ Thanks to Lanegan’s classically dusty tone - famously described as being “scratchy as a three day beard yet as supple as moccasin leather” - and the breadth of Not Waving’s production, the results draw listeners deep into the artists’ shared plane of world-weary but quietly hopeful conception, emphasising the power of closeness and empathy. Their songs come on like waves lapping a shore that’s ever-shifting, ever the same. This cycle is epitomised on the opener, ’Signifying The End’ with Lanegan’s raspy tone met by honeyed synths, before scaling the nocturnal heights of ‘City Of Sin’ and coolly channeling Suicide in ‘Burn Out Babylon.’ The waters calm again for ‘Persimmon Tree’ suitably set to harp-like arps, while the deathly croon and impending throb of ‘Murder In Fugue’ comes to rest in the serene resolution of ‘The Broken Man’ in a manner that’s entirely modernist but speaks to eons of human emotion. Echoing everything from latter-days Scott Walker to David Sylvian at his most strung out, and even the odd energy of Moebius, Conny Plank & Mayo Thompson’s ‘Ludwig’s Law’ album, or the arcane creak of John Duncan’s ‘Bitter Earth’, Natalizia & Lanegan’s efforts will surely realign listeners presumptions of both artists and place them in a category all of their own. less"

The first in a series of TVV’s previously unreleased ‘90s recordings “TV Victor was one of the first artists of Tresor Records where he became legendary with several of his ambient and trance productions including Trance Garden 1-3 and Trancecology Chapter 1. In 1989, he launched his first solo project: Moondance – The Magic Sound of the Moon, where he lay foundations for later explorations with experimental sounds fused with pop elements and anticipated an ambient excursion to be had in the future. In the following decades TV Victor created impressive solo works that traversed between ambient and trance, he collaborated with artists like Moritz v. Oswald, Max Loderbauer, Ari Benjamin Meyers, Paul Browse and Tobias Freud. Contrary to common mainstream tendencies he created a very unique interpretation of both genres. In recent years Victor has concentrated on creating experimental and abstract sonic spaces for escaping reality, spaces that live through the imagination of the listener. Each piece, a segment of a larger musical movement; stands alone to create new sonic continuums. Otherworldy music that is in its own sphere. 30 years after the release of Moondance and 50 years after the first landing, Lullabies For Insomniacs revisit TV Victor’s musical roots with ‘Back To The Moon’.

It was a decisive period that began opening up new possibilities for his very particular approach to sound. Across the first half of the 1990s, Merzbow began touring extensively across Europe, the United States and also in his homeland. It was during this period that the dynamism of Merzbow exploded and the physicality of volume became a primary driver for the experiential capacity of the work. Simultaneously, Merzbow began developing a range of self made instruments and techniques for exploiting found objects as sound sources, which he used in combination with amplifiers to create a unique spectra of noise and feedback both in the studio and live. Noise Mass catalogues a critical period within the continuum of Merzbow. It typifies the radical approaches he developed not just through his music, but also through mastering, pushing the very medium of digital audio to its limit through extreme post-production approaches. Of Noise Masami Akita remarks, “This was around the time Venereology was released from Relapse and the work of Merzbow became more well known to the world. Far greater quantities of that Relapse release were pressed, and much more promotion along with it. In other words, the image of Merzbow's music as it is best known in the world today came from this time. The music of Merzbow has always been a continuum, the piece added this time to Noise Mass, the revised version of Hole, is a work utilising a voice similar in style to Venereology. Listening to both Hole and Venereology, one can appreciate how these works constitute a thread of continuity through this period.” Noise Mass is just that, a ritual of intensity and ferocity that denotes the force that is Merzbow’s approach to noise in the absolute.” less"

   "name": "This is pushing so many buttons for us right now; recordings of flutes and electronics from Brooklyn’s John Also Bennett aka JAB on his debut solo album ‘Erg Herbe’, echoing a fine tradition of loft-based, downtown NYC minimalism and new age ambience that references classic work by La Monte Young and Laurie Speigel as well as quieter intimations of Dominique Lawalrée or Takehisa Kosugi and Bennett’s regular collaborator Jon Gibson. The results are deeply beautiful, in a manner everyone has by now come to expect from the wonderful Shelter Press. A decade in the works, ‘Erg Herbe’ follows 2018’s enchantingly elusive CV & JAB album as John Also Bennett’s 2nd release for Felicia Atkinson and Bartolemé Sanson’s widely adored label. It finds the Brooklyn-based artist in gentle pursuit of a sound which best represents his sense of self, using an array of flutes and synthesisers to imbue a distinguished sense of character into his music in much the same way as the original downtown heroes whose footsteps he follows, with the humble yet ambitious goal to, in his own words; “…create nice, strange, and thoughtful music that reflects a genuine inner vision of self.” In a patient and patently soulful manner befitting of those minimalist and ambient pioneers, Bennett physically breathes life into the album on a C flute, Alto flute, and rare Chinese dizi flute, suspended in space with the gaseous tonal hues of a Yamaha DX711-D, Yamaha CS Reface and Roland Super JV-1080, plus Farfisa Organ. The effect is intoxicatingly rich yet modest, eliding new age spiritual concerns with minimalism’s more scholastic approach - using modified Aphex Twin presets played with a just intonation tuning system, and oscillators “tuned to intuitive structures using intervals of 30Hz” to generate warm and deeply heady harmonic sensations. Underlying and tying this all together is the album’s title, ‘Erg Herbe’, an invented turn of phrase - erg meaning a sea of desert sand dunes, and herbe being french for grass - mirroring the music’s dreamy imagery of rolling green landscapes and blue/pink/orange skies. From the radiant warmth of the opener, to the pastoral waltz of ‘Jacob’s House’, thru the 12 minutes centrepiece of ‘Distant Patterns’ with its raga-like flute and pillowy pads, to the chance midnight meeting of flutes in ‘Chanterai por mon coraige’, recorded in a decrepit mill near the Shelter Press HQ, we’re left zoned out and deeply tuned in to his gorgeous, transcendent music. less"

   "name": "Necessary vinyl edition of a much-adored tape release, likely to charm the pants off Jan Jelinek and To Rococo Rot fans with an intoxicatingly heat-hazy ambient collage inspired by Aegean sojourns. “French lifeguard and sonic artist Roméo Poirier’s long sold out debut tape finally gets a vinyl reissue. “Plage Arrière” is a deep sea meditation on a constellation of Greek beaches across three islands. Trumpets, echo-clicks and Harold Budd-esque shimmer piano whirl together on these seductive scapes, which recall the sub-aqeaous ambitions of Jürgen Müller or Jan Jelinek inspecting a coral reef. Like sand-caked postcards, or pieces of seaglass tumbled and re-engineered by their surroundings, each piece exists a keepsake from the song's namesake beach. These missives glide in and out of earshot, bustling like miniature engines, finely tuned and rhythmically confounding. They echo the factory sampling work of YMO on Technodelic: industrial but somehow good-natured, a symbiosis of machinery and wildlife - like an artificial reef or propeller blades smothered in algae. Plage Arrière is Roméo’s second album this year following “Kystwerk”, where he joined forces with the Norwegian poet Lars Haga Raavand. “Plage” also marks the inaugural release for SWIMS, a new experimental-focused imprint of Cold Blow, who are releasing the LP alongside London label and NTS residents Kit Records. The album has been remastered for vinyl by Sam Annand of Esk. Building on its original artwork, the vinyl edition features new photography by Roméo himself.” less"

Geddes Gengras, clocking in at 2.5 hours of abstract deep space ambience with traces of ‘70s synth epics and ‘90s chill-out functions smudged and teased into diaphanous new abstractions. “To summarise the work of M.Geddes Gengras is no easy feat. A tireless artist, whose output sprawls across experimental dub, ambient and low key techno, his wide ranging discography reveals a curiosity that serves as a primary driver for creation. Light Pipe is arguably Gengras’ most ambitious recording project to date. His 10th solo recording is an epic undertaking, spanning over two and a half hours. Across the two CD set, Gengras charts out evocative landscapes of texture and harmony. Working with very simple elements, he creates a tidal like sound space, where sound layers flow seamlessly, rising and falling with an ever-changing sense of motion. These pieces were written across several years responding the site specific performance situations. These include a durational performance in Los Angeles at The Getty Center’s Irwin Garden, a special performance alongside the banks of the LA river and performances at the El Rey & Regent Theatres, Each disc in this edition focuses specifically on either interior and exterior spaces; the indoor and the outdoor, reflecting the specific conditions of how sound operates in these types of situations. Light Pipe is a long-form work within which multiple states of listening are possible and moreover encouraged. It’s music that is ideal for deep immersion; for sleep, for flying and for any creative states within which a sense of expansion is needed.” less"

   "name": "Glass offers the sublime results of a collaboration between Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai (Alva Noto), as performed and recorded at Philip Johnson’s Glass House in Connecticut during the private opening to Yayoi Kusama’s installation marking the 110th anniversary of Johnson’s birth. Making sterling use of the landmark architectural work’s pellucid dimensions, the pair fixed contact mics to its glass walls, which they effectively played as an “instrument”, rubbing it with rubber gong mallets to generate delicate tones which they combined with a sympathetic palette of singing glass bowls, crotales, keyboards and mixers. The seamless performance of floating, weightless tones and exquisitely quivering timbres is without doubt one of their finest. For the duration we’re held static and spellbound by the pair’s interplay of microtonal shifts and plasmic chronics, keening the listener thru hazes of digital dust and vortices of angelic harmonics to locate, alchemise and resolve a rarified, deeply mysterious spirit before the piece closes. As the follow-up to their OST for The Revenant [2015] and the warbling keys of Summvs [2011] before that, the achingly lush tension of Glass is perhaps the purest testament to the clarity of vision and endless minimalist mutability of this highly revered duo. less"

   "name": "The Collection is an intimate survey of Italian minimalist Nicola Ratti (Bellows) in his element, conducting dusty knocks and electro-acoustic effervescence in a play of greyscale tones and rhythmic irregularities at his Milan studio. Featuring material recorded over a number of years, it’s best considered as summary of Ratti’s personal favourite, unreleased highlights of the past few years, focussing on stray, ostensibly unconnected pieces which, when collected, represent a mosaic of his artistic development and the underlying aesthetics of his identity. Hand-picked by Ratti, The Collection peers into every nook and niche of his elusive style, from fidgeting small sounds redolent of Bellows, to booming slow techno and rolling, reactive dub mutations primed for the ‘floor, each giving a canny insight to the personalised intricacies and underlying inputs of his texturhythmic sound. It’s the kind of music that the machines may make behind our backs or once we’re all gone. But, as it stands, it’s all the work of one man sequestered in his studio with his worries, facing banks of gear and often wondering what the f**k am I going to do today? That may not be instantly detectable to the listener, but as Ratti stresses in the promo text, this is an unspoken aspect of the recording process which belies each of these recordings, if only to him. These outside pressures of artistic endeavour vs capitalist realism thus serve to inform the material’s agitated nature and emotional ambiguity, there in the itchy yet sanguine feel of L2, laced into the quizzical probe of L6, diffused thru the recursive dub-tech system of L1, or rendered in perfectly elusive, gaseous fashion with R401, which arguably defines his sound as uniquely suggestive not prescriptive. less"

   "name": "Arch techno goth Vatican Shadow delivers Berghain’s annual mix, vacillating new and vintage selections with cherry-picked cuts from his unrivalled collection of industrial cassette rarities. Vatican Shadow is a relatively late stage alias for Dominick Fernow, who unmistakably made his name as noise beast Prurient and boss of Hospital Productions since 1997. As the noise scene ran out of conceptual energy around 10 years ago, Dominick found his calling on the ‘floor, forming Vatican Shadow as a vent for his rhythm-focussed industrial music concerns. The project would coalesce around militant drum patterns that found their way into various DJ sets, and Vatican Shadow became a key part of the whole industrial/EBM/darkwave resurgence witnessed over the best part of this decade. With ‘Berghain 09’ Fernow makes his influences and affiliations explicit across the mix and in two accompanying EPs of exclusive gear, collected here. Opening and closing with Genesis P-Orridge mantras ‘Ritual Music’ and ‘One Being, One Orientation, One Power’, he trawls rolling EBM/techno from Juan Mendez (Silent Servant) as Los Angeles Death Cult, the blitzkreig of ‘Venom Timetables’ with Ancient Methods and Regis’ Ugandan Methods, and the agitated pound of ‘Decontrol’ from JK Flesh, while Hospital Productions' Alberich slams out the thistly banger ‘Werkstatt’ along with ‘Colt Neck’ from Ron Morelli, and a handful of distended noise loops by Merzbow.

Really ace album, this, skilfully filleting what they need from vital dance styles and reframing it in a wickedly scratchy, raw and agitated style. Equally adept at going frenetic, frazzled, as they are at swinging deep and wide in ambient pressure systems, Charolastra toggles gauge throughout ‘Hope Is Leaving The Club’ for a sound that’s conversely full of strong, romance feelings for the ‘floor. Where opener ‘Pain’ goes fast and agitated with drum funk squashed into footwork patterns, ‘Power’ plays it deep down and cinematic with lush pads and sparing bass punch, setting an agenda that plays out thru the floating R&B/ghettotech castles in the sky of ‘Entrophy’ and the lo-slung swivel of ‘Lust’, before hitting a killer upturn of DJ Rashad-style funk chops in ‘Trust’, and coming with Braindance electro depths on ‘Resonance’, Rian Treanor-esque madness on ‘Alignment’, and seeing it off sweetly with the gauzy soul of ‘Relief.’ Must check! less"

   "name": "Michael O’Shea’s sole, breathtaking album ranks among our favourite of all time - yet hardly anyone seems to have heard of it. Produced by Wire’s Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis at the Dome studio in 1982, it’s an utterly singular work of magick meshing myriad, worldly modes into music that rarely fails to reduce us to tears. It’s one of those albums that basically sounds like nothing else - the only record we can draw some parallels to is Dariush Dolat-Shahi’s life changing 'Electronic Music, Tar and Sehtar’, despite it coming from the other end of the world. First brought to our attention by Blackest Ever Black at the start of this decade, we’ve gradually developed an obsessive fascination with its sublime, rapid dervishes and warbling rhythmelodies, so it’s a pleasure to see it finally made easily available to everyone who we’ve ranted about it over the years (2nd hand copies have been historically pricey and hard to come by!), and especially replete with its enlightening new sleeve notes by archivist and writer Failed Bohemian. A busker among other trades, O’Shea was an itinerant soul who, after a childhood and formative years spent between Northern Ireland and Kerry in the south of the country, and extensive travel between Europe, Turkey and Bangladesh, created his own instrument - an electrified dulcimer known as Mó Cará (Irish for ‘My Friend’) - which he performed on at Ronnie Scott’s, before later playing on bills with everyone from Ravi Shankar to Don Cherry, and also recording with The The’s Matt and Tom Johnson. Aside from his two contributions to the Stano album, ‘Content To Dine In I Dine Weathercraft’ (also recently reissued by Dublin’s Allchival), O’Shea’s first and only album is the main point of reference for this unique artist. Like some eccentric expression of ancient Indo-European voices channelled thru a Celtic body, Michael O’Shea’s improvised acousto-electric music intuitively distills a world of styles into singularly hypnotic works. Using his self-built instrument; a hybrid of a zelochord and a sitar, made on a wooden door salvaged in Munich, and with the crucial addition of electric pick-ups and the ‘Black Hole Space Box’, O’Shea would absorb sounds from his travels like a sponge, and relay them back thru the instrument with effortlessly freeform and achingly lush results as elaborate as a Celtic knot or elegant as Sanskrit text. The mercurial flow of syncretised styles in 15 minute opener ‘No Journey’s End’ catches your breath and doesn’t give it back, leaving us utterly light-headed and feeling something akin to religious experience, before his ’Kerry’ vignette most beautifully limns the epic coastline he hails from. The plasmic swirl and phasing of ‘Guitar No. 1’ is perhaps the one piece that time dates the LP to the post-punk era, even if it could have come from ancient Mesopotamia, while the album and artist’s underlying metaphysics bleed thru most hauntingly in the timbral shadowplay of ‘Voices’, and the rapidly tremulous, animist voodoo of ‘Anfa Dásachtach’. Noted in his lifetime, not least by himself as; “…joker, transvestite, inventor, psychonaut, actor, catalyst, community worker, musician, traveller, instrument maker,” Michael O’Shea’s life was, by all accounts, every bit as colourful as his music, which only makes his untimely death in 1991 all that more tragic, as we’d practically give an arm to hear what he could have made in the early techno era, as he was purportedly getting heavy into London’s rave scene before he was taken. Honestly no other record has cast such a strong spell over us in recent memory - to the extent of sending us on wild goose chases on the wrong peninsula in Kerry - so please pardon the gush ‘cos we can’t help but share love for this life-affirming disc and Michael O’Shea’s beautifully transcendent music. less"

   "name": "First time vinyl (2LP) pressing of Atom Heart’s 1994 ambient album as Dots, originally released by his mighty Rather Interesting label and now newly prepped by Uwe Schmidt himself and cut by Noel Summerville for Astral Industries. Modestly self-described by Schmidt aka Dots as “elevator music”, the project’s only release is defined by its spacious parameters and paucity of palette, using icy arps and plangent bleeps to connote a wide, free-floating sense of vastness and airy detachment. If it is “elevator music”, then it’s surely made for a glass-bottomed lift to the moon and beyond. Trailing in the shimmering wake of Astral Industries' reissues by Sonmi451, Chi Factory and Heavenly Music Corporation, ‘Dots’ sweetly follows suit with an assurance of no sharp edges or snagging tones for the ardent psychonaut or ambient explorer, working in a very ‘90s way where a utopian trust was implied between artist and listener that says, “we’ve got you” in the come-down session, or when used as an aid for sleeping or for simply escaping your own mind. To be fair, there was a long period (that only ended during this decade) when ambient music of this ilk was viewed as a bit lukewarm or toothless. But there’s certainly been a sea change in tastes that have lead to folk prizing the potential for this kind of background or environmental music to induce visions of lost halcyons, or perhaps even subliminally gird themselves and become familiar with an early form of cybernetic intelligence, before it becomes overly familiar with us. If, like many sets of ears, you’re exhausted with reissued new age and kosmiche records, but still favour a pre or early-internet electronic soul, this album will push all the right buttons. less"

   "name": "Eminent avant-garde/experimental explorer Oren Ambarchi opens a rewarding new avenue to embrace the warmth and mystic psychedelia of Brazilian music with assistance from celebrated percussionist and Downtown luminary Cyro Baptista. Arriving just after Ambarchi’s 50th birthday, and Black Truffle's 10th, ‘Simian Angel’ sees him yoke back from the forward tilt of his rhythm-driven outings over the past decade in order to focus on his electric guitar playing, with utterly sublime results. Keening sideways from the unyielding percussion of his last outing ‘Hubris’ [2016], he divines a floating space that recalls the beautifully pensile cats cradle of his early classic ‘Grapes From The Estate’ [2004], only this time with fleshlier, more inviting arrangements. The first half’s ’Palm Sugar Candy’ is pure star-gazing material, with Baptista’s hand-played, self-built percussion drawing us into a horizontal headspace while Ambarchi’s glowing notes gently colour the sky above. Ambarchi gradually opens up a glorious space between that dissonant murmuring and an awning, harmonic meridian, where a voice whispers into the space to gently recalibrate our depth perception, before seemingly turning his guitar into a MIDI-triggering aeolian harp in the piece’s spellbinding, levitating 2nd half. ’Simian Angel’ follows with a more gripping rhythmic pull from the twanging Berimbau, just one of myriad percussion mastered by Baptista (who has previously played with everyone from John Zorn to Derek Bailey, Herbie Hancock and Robert Palmer), before Ambarchi glydes into view like a chorus of the sighing Simian Angels, drawing the piece upwards into thin air, where his guitar melts into piano and columns of warm air carry distant vocals from below. The drums rejoin to mark the work’s final avian swoops in strokes and dashes, triggering MIDI keys in a beautifully colourful sort of jazz fusion call and response, located amid and above a subtropical canopy. Arriving at the apparent apex of a long and sprawling career in which he's had countless collaborations and gone down a seemingly endless series of creative rabbit holes, 'Simian Angel’ is quite possibly Oren Ambarchi’s most open and generous album to date - a perfect entry point into, as well as highlight of, a recorded catalogue that over the course of more than twenty years has been one of the most unpredictable and rewarding in the game.

   "name": "Carsten Nicolai concludes Alva Noto’s UNI-prefixed release cycle with UNIEQAV, the 3rd and most dancefloor-focussed instalment of the series. The follow-up to Unitxt [2008] and Univrs [2011] pairs pendulous minimal techno and electro rhythms with wide, sheer electronic drones in a way that strongly recalls recent Monolake output as well as Ilpo Väisänen in full swang. Comparisons aside, though, it’s unmistakably Alva Noto. Pursuing the project’s roots in the dancefloor of Tokyo’s UNIT club to a satisfyingly logical endpoint, Nicolai rolls out 12 typically mercurial yet gripping sound designs defined by their fluid dynamics and seemingly fathomless dimensions intended to render the club or your head underwater, thanks to a still remarkable grasp of purified tonal minimalism/maximalism and studied sensitivity to proprioception. The results are filigree yet robust, firmed up for deployment on the sickest sound system you can lay your hands on, but also highly pleasurable in a headphone or sofa-inclined context, keeping us rapt and twitching from the dubwise plong and looming pads of Uni Sub and the Robert Henke-esque pressure systems of Uni Mia. The nervous skeleton of Uni Version flows into singular Alva Noto sounds in the jabbing pointillism of Uni Clip and the staggering scale of Uni Normal, with major highlights in the widescreen drama of Uni Blue, and footwork-like rapid movement join Uni Edit, while Anne-James Chaton’s vocal lend a sharp contrast in Uni Dna. less"

   "name": "First ever official vinyl reissue of Neil Young’s beyond-classic 1996 soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man' - a mesmerising exercise in tightly controlled improvisation mostly made up of solo electric guitar interspersed with organ, piano, field recordings and excerpts of Johnny Depp reciting William Blake. Sounds awful - we know - but actually a uniquely gripping, inspired piece of work - one of the great soundtracks of the late 20th century. Vague recollections of the film and its fever-dream topographies are most likely responsible for the almost mystical aura that surrounds ‘Dead Man', but Young does much to heighten its bizarre sense of place with a process of recording that was both off the cuff and bursting with inspiration - taking things to almost transcendental dimensions. Young improvised on his electric guitar Old Black in real time as he watched the film in his studio, throwing in bits of dialogue between tracks and - most bizarrely - lots of weird ambient sounds that aren't in the film - including a prominent car engine running in the background - something that makes no sense for a film set in the 19th century. It all adds to a sense of physical and metaphysical displacement that's connected to but not reliant on any knowledge of the film, running its own sense of fuzzy logic. Musically, it reminds us of everything from John Fahey’s ‘Red Cross’ to the more introspective end of Goran Bregović’s soundtrack work for Emir Kusturica, or even Ry Cooder’s iconic Paris Texas, Bruce Langhorne’s 'The Hired Hand’ and classic Earth playing at the same time as some weird field recordings open on another tab.

   "name": "An advanced masterclass in Berlin beat science, ‘Wireless’ is the final and arguably strongest solo release by T++; aka Torsten Pröfrock, an artist with a long lineage of important releases under numrous aliases - Dynamo, Erosion,Log, Resilent, Traktor, Various Artists and more - a true pillar of Berlin's Techno legacy. First issued by Honest Jon’s in 2010, the 2x12” features samples of singer and ndingidi-player Ssekinomu (originally found on the EMI archival dive ‘Bellyachers, Listen - Songs From East Africa, 1938-46’) reworked by Pröfrock into a volley of rambunctious but rudely disciplined club workouts some 75 years later. In many other hands, this could have been just another passable cut ’n splice edit, but T++ treats the material with a balance of reverence and raving license, highlighting an instinctive understanding of the original music's intent and purpose, and their deep rooted connection to modern fast rap and hardcore dance musics. The four tracks amount to a contemporary classic in their field and also exist in a strong tradition of German artists ranging from Stockhausen to Can and Basic Channel whose music has crucially incorporated the fluid, rolling nature and spectra of African drumming patterns. However, it’s vital to point out that T++’s take on African drumming is also filtered thru a love of UK music - Jungle, D&B, garage, dubstep - meaning that his rhythms are properly underlined with syncopated, technoid basslines owing as much to Kingston, Jamaica as Brixton and Sheffield in the UK. For anyone who had been intently listening to Pröfrock's output since his Traktor gems, thru his Dynamo aces, to early work with Monolake and his string of seminal T++ 12”s in the 2000’s, on its release in 2010 ‘Wireless’ quickly came to epitomise his approach to broken techno production at its most open-ended and inexorable. Between the itchy, sprung step of ‘Cropped’, the puckish darkside torque of ‘Anyi’, a voodoo communal in ‘Voice No Bodies’, and the reanimated spirits of ‘Dig’ you have some of the finest mutant techno ever cut to vinyl.

The B-side follows on that vibe with the EP’s sublime highlight of weightless drums and ‘floor-cradling ambient strokes ‘Espero’, and ‘Be Si To’ crisply defines his dembow house stride at a balmy 110bpm beside the bleary-eyed and screwed rave suss of ‘PQ CQ.’ less"

   "name": "Some time around 20 years ago, Dub Surgeon made an absorbing album of beautiful dub infused with ambience, found sounds and horizontal rhythms. 'The Lost Future' was recorded at the former Amsterdam Film Academy, engineered and mastered by Ricardo Villalobos who put it through several vintage mixers and recorded it to 2 inch tape. Then, tragedy struck: a storm surged and ignited a fire that ravaged the studio. The master copy was thought to have been lost forever. Dub Surgeon stopped making music and disappeared into the shadows after just two EPs on Future Dub in 2002/3. But one day, 15 years later, and totally out of the blue, he received a demo of The Lost Future. \"Pay attention to this,\" it said. Attached was a demo version of the long lost album which now, finally, has found a home on Dubai's Ark to Ashes imprint, so named in homage to the story of Lee \"Scratch\" Perry burning down his Black Ark studio to rid it of demons. Newly mastered by Rashad Becker, the album adopts its full form as a killer dub excursion which, with hindsight, can be marked up next to other electronic dub classics of its era, arguably right up there with the first two Pole albums, but also wickedly prescient of wilder, out-of-the-lines styles to come from Jay Glass Dubs to Seekersinternational, and even flashes of Hyperdub and Burial’s more abstract, introspective moments. less"

   "name": "‘On Vanishing Land’ is legendary writer/theorist Mark Fisher’s deep topographical reading of the Suffolk Coast, conceived in 2006 for his former CCRU comrade Kodwo Eshun’s (and co’s) Otolith Group. The text is narrated by Justin Barton, who previously voiced John Foxx’s ‘The Quiet Man’, and set to suitably haunting sonic backdrops by the likes of Foxx, plus Raime and Baron Mordant. It’s issued as the first release on Flatlines, a sublabel of Hyperdub,which of course belongs to another of his CCRU comrades, Steve Goodman aka Kode 9. A must check! “Hyperdub launch new sub-label, Flatlines, for the vinyl and digital release of On Vanishing Land, an audio-essay by Justin Barton and the late Mark Fisher. OVL evokes a walk along the Suffolk coastline in 2006, from Felixstowe container port (\"a nerve ganglion of capitalism\") to the Anglo-Saxon burial ground at Sutton Hoo. A walk under immense skies, through zones of deep time and within sunlit, liminal terrains, into the eerie. Everywhere there are charged atmospheres, shadowy incursions, enigmatic departures. A derelict radar base, coastal heathland, drifting thistledown, towers of overgrown shipping containers - music haunted by wider levels of reality, narrations about rarely visited zones and potentials, voices of dreams and stories. Newly composed tracks by John Foxx, Gazelle Twin, Baron Mordant, Raime, Pete Wiseman, Farmers of Vega, Skjolbrot, Eerie Anglia, Ekoplekz and Dolly Dolly; and, alongside these, views toward M.R. James’s Oh Whistle and I’ll Come to You My Lad (1904), Joan Lindsay’s Picnic at Hanging Rock (1967), and Brian Eno’s On Land (1982). Beyond the surface of the day something becomes visible, a way forward, an escape-path from capitalist reality. On Vanishing Land is about following the lines of terrains and dreams. It is about a micropolitics of escape, of disappearance. A micropolitics of waking the faculties. “It is April, but it feels like summer. They turn left onto the seafront […]” On Vanishing Land was initially part of an exhibition commissioned by The Otolith Collective and The Showroom in London, and after londonunderlondon (2005) it was the second audio-work collaboration by Justin Barton and Mark Fisher. The LP cover features photos taken by Mark Fisher and a short essay by Justin Barton.” less"

   "name": "Recorded in Nashville with the legendary engineer Rob Galbraith, ‘Nashlantis’ features 11 mesmerizing Gantry performances (“a séance with the Human Spirit,” as the producer puts it), retouched in Austin with painterly brevity by DeCicca and Stuart Sikes. Preserving the intimate nature of Chris’s acoustic guitar and vocals, Don Cento, Ryan Jewell and Marina Peterson wove electric guitar, mandolin, synthesizer, percussion and cello into the fabric of the songs and guest harmony vocalists Edith Frost and Bill Callahan added stellar contributions as well. \"'Nashlantis’ is inevitably a reflection on Gantry’s long and winding path through this world - but the vitality of the songwriting stops the music from becoming simple elegy or denouement. Chris’s crafty old-school way with a tune and his smooth melodicism gives him the space to tell his tales with ease; lovers, losers and madmen are depicted with warmth and empathy, a genuine love of the human spirit and the singing chops of a man who’s known tens of thousands of nights of song. ‘Nashlantis’ is a testament to the career and talent of Chris Gantry - the individualism that set him apart from his earliest days and his openhearted embrace of the unknown. Jerry David DeCicca’s production sound makes for yet another unique chapter in the Chris Gantry catalogue - a potent new entry, five decades and more down the line - the improbability of which makes it pure Gantry, all the way. The annals of Nashville, the 20th Century’s immortal Music City, are filled with lore of the legends, as well as tales of the one-shots, the lesser-knowns and the delightful obscurities: singers, writers and players who had a moment, were a step away from stardom or just stood in the same room with the men and women whose names we know. Like the outlaw he defines himself as, Chris Gantry doesn’t really fit in any of those boxes - and 50-plus years since he wrote his first and biggest hit, he’s still writing and singing, having lived to tell the tale of his serpentine but ultimately joyful path, a ‘Life Well Lived’. Now in his mid-70s, Gantry is still a consummate performer and an inveterate writer, appearing in performance as a lusty, genial man, grateful to have drunk of the experience he’s had, transcendent in that experience and ebullient in the moment of singing it. ‘Nashlantis’ is the ninth record of Gantry tunes to be released since Chris moved to Nashville in early 1960. Then, he fell in with like-minded others: Shel Silverstein, Kris Kristofferson, Eddie Rabbitt, Vince Matthews and Mickey Newbury - guys working day and night to break into the business, writing and singing their way through the chaos of their youth. It was an intoxicating environment - everyone with his own vision and Chris’s cosmic stirrings setting him a little apart from the rest. He first got a contract to make an album after Glenn Campbell’s version of his tune ‘Dreams of the Everyday Housewife’ went to Number Three on the Billboard Country Charts in 1967. Between 1968 and 1975, he recorded three madly diverse records, released by three different imprints - Monument, Magic Carpet (a Monument subsidiary) and ABC Dot. One other session from that time sat in the can for over 40 years, until Drag City put it out in 2017 as ‘At The House Of Cash’. Meanwhile, the fellow who brought that long-lost project to Drag City, Jerry David DeCicca (a singer and performer in his own right, who also co-produced the Larry Jon Wilson album released back in 2008), was producing a new record for Chris.\" less"

   "name": "‘Only You’ spotlights French pianist/ composer Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch’s score to the film of the same name starring Laia Costa and Josh O’Connor and directed by newcomer Harry Wootliff. \"This selection of four cues from the original score sees its composer dialing into the intimacy of the narrative. Just like the film itself, the instrumentation for the original score of 'Only You' is intimate, focusing on two elements only - cello and piano, often layered and with subtle electronic manipulations. These four longest cues from the film express what the two lead characters, Elena (Costa) and Jake (O'Connor), can't or won't say out loud, with the music and melodies becoming the voices of their emotions. ‘Separation’ opens proceedings with a gentle piano score performed beautifully by Christina McMaster. ‘Where We Are’ and ‘Sorry I Missed Your Call’ are composed for solo cello and performed by Gregor Riddell. The former with its use of delay and sense of space recalls the late great Arthur Russell; whilst the latter overlays the staccato processing with a beautiful bowed melody. Closing out the EP, ‘End Scene’ marries the two cello modes with the piano, this time played by Emilie herself. All four brief tracks were recorded by Sean Woodlock at Goldsmiths Music Studio and were mastered by Martyn Heyne at Lichte Studio.” less"

Recorded in a single afternoon in Brooklyn, Leila’s debut album of unprocessed amplified cello recordings in ‘Headflush’ render an arrestingly detached yet immersive perspective on her instrument - which is commonly known to mirror the range of the human voice. With this is mind, Leila’s recordings speak to a sense of disembodiment or an out of body experience, drawing the instrument’s Ur voice out of itself and into space where she reinforces and makes it sigh thick smoky tones pealing with stressed partials in a way that wouldn’t sound out of place on the ‘Eraserhead’ soundtrack. It’s most excellent. “Leila Bordreuil is a Brooklyn-based cellist, composer, and sound-artist from France. She accesses concepts as diverse as jazz, contemporary classical, noise, and experimental traditions but adheres to her own vision of sound. The New York Times has described her work as “steadily scathing music, favoring long and corrosive atonalities”. Driven by a fierce interest in pure sound and inherent texture, Bordreuil challenges conventional cello practice through extreme extended techniques and amplification methods. Her composed works frequently incorporate sound-spatialization by way of site-specific pieces and multichannel installations.” less"

Hannya masks capture the stages of transformation of a female character as she undergoes a metamorphosis into a demon / ogre. This transformation is caused by deep sadness and anger, fuelled by intense jealousy. The mask embodies the resentment and fierce obsession of this character. Its horrible look gives us an impression that it is not just a grotesque monster, but that it also expresses the deep sadness of human beings. A cautionary tale of the power of negative emotions portrayed aptly in this infamous play. Hannya masks are also very popular with tattooists around the world along with many other characters and symbols from the fascinating Japanese mythology.

Hits right between the eyes of Stroom chin-up Soviet disko and the earliest strains of Eurobeat. We can only imagine this music must have been a major splash of colour against the backdrop of brutalist tower blocks and strained socio-politics in late ‘80s Warsaw, although trying to imagine this soudtracking Kieślowski's Dekalog is causing our minds to short circuit... “Akuphone presents a compilation of Władysław Komendarek, the Polish genius of synthesizers. This selection comes from three albums released between 1987 and 1990, a very important political and social period in Poland, marked by the last convulsions of communism. Komendarek’s music offers a unique patchwork of synthesizer sounds, “art of noise” and cosmic flights far beyond the realm of conventions that dominated the Polish electronic music scene at the time. It brings a weird mixture of electronic, proto-techno, eurodance and progressive music. Instrumentalist and composer, Władysław Komendarek (born in 1948 in Sochaczew, Poland) was a member of the legendary group Exodus in the 1973-1983 period. But the pioneering achievements of Komendarek in the field of electronic music were revealed with glory in the 1980s with the start of his solo career. Equipped with various analogue synthesizers –even some of his own manufacture–, he began to explore the sounds of the Earth and the Cosmos. Intensely drawn to electronic instruments, he tried to use them to their maximum capacity. For over forty years now, he has been a restless and tireless seeker of beyond-the-earthly sounds hiding in synthesizers which he has tried to reveal to the world. Thanks to their richness, the liner notes provide an immersion into the Polish electronic music scene. Written by the musical journalist Łukasz Komła, liner notes include a text on Władysław Komendarek, Pioneer and rebel by choice, a Brief history of electronic music in Poland, a short biography and a paper on the Social and political context in Poland in the 80s.” less"

Fishof performs his music regularly as part of his solo multimedia and dance works. He also has an improvised music duo with conductor and music curator Ilan Volkov. Soundtracks aside, ALBUM 1 is Ohad Fishof’s first solo album. Some of the music on it was originally created in the context of other art projects, and was then rearranged for inclusion here. Technically electro-acoustic, stylistically idiomatic and liminal, ALBUM 1 carries a strong sense of narrative and seems to be taking place somewhere in the fantasy territory of ethnographic fiction.

They variously transition from wide-open to busy, hyper-populated zones of enquiry and back again, but paradoxically enough all come as the result of one man in his spare room, composing inside a pair of headphones. Change of circumstances meant that Fennesz couldn’t use his usual studio and by necessity was limited to what was at hand in his spare bedroom-turned-studio - just like the old days when he wrote his first record. These limitations pushed him further to explore worlds of possibility contained within his guitar and computer, with drily functional titles such as ‘In My Room’ invoking ideas from both Alvin Lucier and J.G. Ballard to explore vast realms of reverberant, imaginary space, while ‘Rainfall’ feels to emulate a lush spring downpour over bust city streets, all splitting greys and oil and concrete reflection, and ‘Agora’ radiates into every corner of the synthesised soundfield with gloriously detached, isolationist effect, alongside the bittersweet then and coruscating texture of ‘We Trigger The Sun’. less"

If we’re to drily break it down, it’s a result of highly attuned intuition, a singular palette, and a no-f*cks-given attitude. But on another level it’s simply cranky magick in the mold of Demdike’s own cut ’n splice mixtapes or their killer production reels by Iueke. Trust Madteo's taking no prisoners inside; the session slips down a mental wormhole between head-wobbling subbass smudge, spongiform kicks and throttled tones that only occasionally allow us listeners to come up for air. It all feels digestive, intestinal and utterly grotty in the best way, connoting the murky afterglow from a satisfyingly mucky weekend of bassbin massages and hanging out with good rotters. You know the sort you can’t wash off for days. \"yeah, it's for the headz\" less"

   "name": "Peach-dealer Jonny Trunk presents a ripe beauty with Ernest Berk’s haunting, technoid 1970 ballet soundtrack - newly rediscovered and remastered from original pressing by Jon Brooks (The Advisory Circle). Receiving a long overdue release proper, ‘Electronic Music For Two Ballets’ is the first readily available example of Berk’s conviction that electronic music best suits contemporary experimental dance performance. He was hardly the first to acknowledge this - Merce Cunningham and John Cage, Pierre Henry, Xenakis all wrote music for contemporary dance - but this rare, surviving example of Berk’s work perhaps most starkly highlights a line from his work to the stripped down, keen angularity of Jlin’s stunning score for Wayne McGregor’s ‘Autobiography’ in 2018. And it’s with thanks to Jonny Trunk that we can even hear Berk’s piece to draw that link, as the original LP was long thought lost in a tragic collapse of the Historical Archive Of The City Of Cologne, who owned his entire collection, until a copy mercifully resurfaced with his family. With interest in Berk piqued some years ago by a Wire article, which lead to fruitless searches for his music, this LP, along with a couple of tracks on the CD accompanying Ian Halliwell’s ‘Tape Leaders’ book, make a scant amount of Berk’s work now available in the public sphere. It serves to prove he had a keen understanding of electronic music’s potential to generate thrilling movement in dancers, just as the rest of the world has realised over the past 30 years on a much wider scale. A dancer himself, who arrived in England after fleeing the Nazis, Berk “feels that electronic music is able to express the feelings of contemporary society in a more potent and communicative way than conventional forms of music”, according to the original LP sleevenotes. As you’ll hear in the LP, he patently uses electronic music for its suggestively proprioceptive/spatial qualities, using it to create clearly structured yet abstract narrative frameworks of communication between dancers and audience. Following a theme about “modern youth and its ritualistic behaviour” you hardly need to know that to enjoy this record. It’s a must-check for anyone fascinating by the deep, instinctive connection between electronic music and dancing bodies. less"

   "name": "The tender results of a dialogue between photographer Nieves Mingueza and musicians Craig Tattersall (The Humble Bee, The Boats) and Offthesky forms their gently bucolic debut album for France’s iikki label. ‘All Other Voices Gone, Only Yours Remains’ is every bit as low-key, hushed, and user-friendly as you might hope for from artist of this genteel calibre. Craig Tattersall brings his sweetly dilapidated palette of piano, guitar, vibes, synths and tape loops to Jason Corder’s vibes and mixing arrangement of sax, viola, cello, flute and voice by his regular instrumentalists, conjuring the feel of last of the organic summer wine drunk slowly by babbling brooks on a bright, sunny day turning into evening. Melodies trickle and harmonies breeze in a heat hazy way, pollinating sounds that bloom and turn to honey in the space of each of the album’s seven songs. Wistfully poetic titles such as ‘For Her Breath Is On All That Hath Life’ and ‘Bee-Like, Death-Like’ surely signify the project’s themes and feel, conveying a fondness for the natural world that bleeds through the music’s overlapping textures and structures and speaks to its visual stimuli provided by Nieves Mingueza, and her aim to reflect the “foggy relationship between fiction and reality.” less"

   "name": "‘Selections from 100 Models of Hegikan Roku’ is the stunning, second major Catherine Christer Hennix work to appear on vinyl via NYC’s Blank Forms Editions and Empty Editions following ‘Selected Early Keyboard Works’ - one of 2018’s certified albums of the year. Let's just say that this one hits even harder. Read on. Proceeding to fill crucial gaps in Hennix’s 60 year (and counting) ouevre, her 1976 recording with The Deontic Miracle (a trio with her brother Peter Hennix, and Hans Isgren, whom she described as “the most rejected band ever formed in Sweden”) presents utterly compelling tracts from a mind-blowing 90 minute exploration of the Just Intonation tunings that have fascinated Hennix since her late ‘60s studies with La Monte Young and Henry Flynt. Just Intonation, on a technical level, operates in contrast to the equal temperament tunings most common to the familiar harmonics of western music. On another level, Just Intonation is deeply, deeply f*cking weird and subversive, working with its own laws of visceral dissonance and harmonic relationships that rarely fails to result in anything less than a life-affirming or even cathartic experience when applied by Hennix and her band. Honestly some of the most memorable and unshakeable moments of our listening lives can be attributed to this system, and almost everything else pales in significance after it’s been properly experienced. It’s no less revelatory than formative acid trips, and it boggles the mind that so much so-called “psychedelic” music doesn’t even come close to the effect of Hennix’s recordings. Rigorously working within this mathematically sound and ancient system, with Catherine on Amplified Renaissance Oboe, Live Electronics and Sine Wave Generators, her brother Peter on Amplified Renaissance Oboe and Amplified Sarangi, and Hans Isgren on Amplified Sarangi, there’s an unparalleled aggression and intensity to the trio’s playing in ‘Selections from 100 Models of Hegikan Roku’ that was previously found on their ‘Central Palace Music’ CD of the same sessions for Important in 2016, and also more stripped down in Catherine’s incredible ‘Selected Early Keyboard Works’. This is not psychedelic music for braiding daisies or growing your hair to. It’s psychedelic in an atavistic, frightening and metaphysical way, ripping down the curtains of melody and meter from the sound stage to reveal surrealistic, pineal panoramas of a sort rarely seen by humankind, and then holds your view like the Ludovico technique apparatus applied to Malcolm McDowell’s character in A Clockwork Orange. And similarly, the music can be heard as a conditioning against the strictures of classical music, prizing open its form and highlighting all the dark energy and negative ecstasy that haunts the harmonic spectrum, yet which sadly remains invisible to the naked ear in most western musics. If ever there was a music that makes you want to f*ck, fight, drop mescaline, or most simply to feel sensations you’ve never come across before and really can’t properly explain, this is it. Not to push it out too much, but the resurfacing of Hennix’s recordings over the past decade feel prophetically profound in these times; where too much music retreads old ground, this shit feels like a message from aliens or previous civilisations bitchslapping our ears and crying out for us all to listen and perceive sound, and the world, differently. less"

Started in 2012 with ‘Glacial’ and taking in the deco rave minimisations of ‘Xeric’ (2014), ‘Ulex’ (2015), and ‘Aqal’ (2017), Dale’s Entr’acte run has consistently, playfully toyed with ideas of anticipation and stylistic convention in electronic music for the best part of this decade. With ‘Enhex’ he yields one of the most forceful instalments with the same strict methodology that we’ve come to know and love about his music. Sonically ascetic as Mark Fell and as rude as Russell Haswell, but with a queered tactility of his own, Dale continues to plough his own groove in ‘Enhex.’ From the spittly, gasping blatz and gut punch kicks of crowd favourite ‘Enhex Pattern 1’ he does it singularly throughout all 9 cuts. Whether diffusing boomy bass hits and flickering rimshots into acres of nothingness on ‘Enhex Pattern 2’, coming like a stoned Alva Noto in ‘Enhex Pattern 4’, really crushing on your cochleas with ‘Enhex Pattern 5’, or dancing with killer, ricochet dynamics in ‘Enhex Pattern 8’, Dale very knowingly moves in between the lines of convention, locating canny routes of investigation which, for all their ostensibly minimal construction, open vast playgrounds and suggest slightest prompts for the listener’s imagination and body to cut loose. less"

   "name": "Blume once again expand our horizons with this remastered reissue of the sole recorded output of visual artist Winfried Mühlum-Pyrápheros, originally released as a small private pressing in Germany, 1970, and known by no more than a handful of heads in the years since. If you have an interest in minimalism, sacred music, the work of Fluxus, Tony Conrad, Henry Flynt, or indeed Eliane Radigue and Jani Christou - we urge you to dive head-first into this precious find from one of the best labels in the game. Following a long but elusive line of Artist Records - records made by artists whose primary output exists within the context of visual rather than sound art (see Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwiters, Dieter Roth, Joseph Beuys etc), this highly absorbing work for organ, violin, percussion and triangle was recorded at a Franciscan church in Bensheim and follows a graphic notation system made by Muhlum-Pyrapheros (an image of which is included in the liner notes) which offered the players a common path for the recording. Originally intended as a musical accompaniment for a slide presentation of his work, Musica Nova Contemplativa is essentially an acoustic extension of his art, described by Bradford Bailey as “...a lost work from the height of musical minimalism”. \"Droning and tense, subtle melodic elements underpin sheets of tone and atonality, sculpting an incongruous sense of spacial ambience, the conception of Musica Nova Contemplativa, drew on a unique, unfixed compositional system, created by combining traditional musical notation with mobile and variable elements, expressed graphically as a system of coordinates which leave variation, interpretation, and improvisation up to the performer. Captured as eleven distinct movements, the work, with hindsight, can now be understood as lost, freestanding work of musical minimalism - echoing idiom’s roots in Fluxus and the raw temperaments of artists like Tony Conrad and Henry Flynt, threaded with touchstones in the work of Eliane Radigue, Giacinto Scelsi, and Jani Christou. Born in Germany during 1941 and educated in philosophy and psychology, over the last half century the bulk of Winfried Mühlum-Pyrápheros’ artistic output has been largely oriented around painting, sculpture, and installation, each focused on the experiences of phenomena, environment, and light. Musica Nova Contemplativa, beginning as graphic score, composed in 1964, then interpreted and recorded by Mühlum-Pyrápheros on violin and Johann Georg Ickler on organ, three years later in a Franciscan church in Bensheim, is a logical extension of the artists broader concerns - seeking further territories of inclusive and expansive environments of experience. Intended as acoustic extensions of his paintings, the collective contents of the album are a metaphysical and esoteric rising in sound.\" less"

   "name": "Gogeous, while-away ambient improv thought bubbles expressed in the northern wilds of Canada. A must check for fans of Jonny Nash, Suzanne Kraft and Gigi Masin works... “Like many Canadians, Joseph Shabason and Ben Gunning like to untangle themselves from urbanity and disappear up north a few times a year. Unlike other cottage-goers, Ben and Joseph don’t while away the ur-time on jet-skis and lounge on docks reading pulpy mysteries. Instead, they bring a car full of synths, drum machines, saxophones, guitars, samplers, effects, and recording equipment to jam the days away in a cabin-fever inducing haze of wood smoke, cedar musk, hot wires and jazz sweat. Muldrew, recorded on the northern Ontario lake by that name, is the culmination of several years of this collaborative tradition. Resisting their penchant for composition and arrangement, the duo embarked on this project with only an open framework that encouraged restraint. The result is a sparse and improvisational album, hung on enough structure for each song to evoke a distinct, albeit ambiguous mood. Space is paramount and even the most digital elements breathe with the resonance of the room and mingle with creaking floors. The resulting album is steeped in the placid stillness and northern ambience of a lake at dawn, and the emotive expanse of a forest at dusk. Imagine an ECM cottage-series, or Jon Hassell, Hiroshi Yoshimura, and John Martyn scoring a Bela Tarr film set in rural Canada. This is the future-proof music of metropolitan polyglot minds invigorated by nature’s mute refusal to follow a click-track.” less"

   "name": "Necessary reissue of super rare recordings by Juju master Ojo Balingo and band, sung and recorded In the Yoruba language (and other indigenous tongues) for the domestic Nigerian market Basically ‘Tabansi’ is music written by and for Nigerians, or specifically the Yoruba diaspora which nowadays makes up a fifth of the Nigerian population. Juju is distinguished from Highlife, which was written mostly for Western audiences and sung in pidgin English. While slight, the differences are crucial, and essentially Juju of the sort played by Ojo Balingo and his amazing band is the real deal Yoruban music, more often played on local instruments, sung in local tongues, and absolutely full of mesmerising West African percussive voodoo, with some era-appropriate ‘70s funk breaks and psyche Hawaiian guitars to boot. “Popularised all over the globe by King Sunny Ade in the 1980s, juju music had actually been around for decades before. Resembling highlife music in many ways, juju could be described as a more traditionally African form, mainly played by Yoruba people for Yoruba audiences.Although the original sleeve artwork implies that this is a ‘various artists’ album, it’s pretty clear that it’s the same unnamed juju band throughout, performing two long tracks, one on each side. Side 1 calls forth more traditional juju sounds, whilst the darker Side 2 adds funk breaks galore. Psych-rock Hawaiian guitars, talking drums and political lyrics rub shoulders in this almost-unknown 70s juju rarity. Ojo Balingo, in Yoruba, means ‘rain comes’, or ‘a breeze comes’. And so it does, with this never-before reissued obscure collectors’ vinyl from the vaults of Tabansi Records.” less"

While the definition of \"Berlin techno\" seems to have calcified around the dub chords and 4/4 formula in recent years, it's all the more important that the music on 'Außen Vor' reveals an ostensibly hidden history of Berlin dance music that’s as much influenced by UK Hardcore and D&B and the mechanics of the scene that followed, from Autechre in the UK, to the Schematic axis in Miami - all equally important, for us at least, to it's evolution, and an influence and predecessor to those contemporary artists who have continued to operate outside the margins. less"

Both sides of the equation maintain a tense equilibrium throughout the album, which, while originally divided in five parts, played thru seamlessly, whereas this new vinyl cut dedicates nearly a side per piece. Across its taut body Palestine and Pan Sonic sustain gossamer fine chords and swollen, sometimes unruly bass, appearing to under-do each other and never making any moves, but the tension just gives at point, sinking into subbass mire and slipping trains of thought out of line. It’s perhaps not entirely typical of either of them, and achieves a modest mix of their respective sensibilities. less"

In two floating, durational pieces, separated by a pealing five minute ambient flute arrangement, Cantu-Ledesma and pals remind us exactly why we’ve followed his work so intently all these years.

However, that’s what we and many others are probably hoping for, and it’s surely delivers as the 20 minute opener flows its course of silvery piano streaks and softened metallic resonances with the warmest sentiment. The intermediary ‘Joy’ is slightly sharper focussed, as though rubbing the ears lense to allow Sielaff’s bass clarinet break the murk in slow, flitting saccades, before ‘Tracing Back The Radiance’ resumes a form of serene sonic therapy with melting sounds and ear-nuzzling timbral complexities which, in turn, relax and harmonise the world around us and make everything more manageable, even if only temporarily. less"

Born in 1948 in Lyallpur (now named Faisalbad after decolonisation in 1979), Nusrat was the son of a famous Qawwali vocalist— Ustad Fateh Ali Khan. Trained to be a doctor but studying Qawwali tradition secretly or with his father, Nusrat only accepted the vocation of singer after a dream: Ustad came to him, ten days after his death, and asked his 16-year-old son to sing. Nusrat declined, but after his father had touched his throat, he found the gift had come to him. As the dream continued, his father took him to a holy place, the dargah of Ajámer Sharif in Rajasthan, India. With that Vision, Nusrat devoted himself to Qawwali, his powerful voice and concentrated expression lifting the music above the vulgarisations that represented Qawwali’s populist face in the Bollywood film industry. But despite a huge back-catalogue of more traditional concert recordings, Nusrat is no purist. His collaborations with Peter Gabriel, Bally Sagoo, Massive Attack and, most recently, Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder for the acclaimed Dead Man Walking soundtrack or a proposed duet with Bjork, have pushed Qawwali beyond all previous boundaries.” less"

He filled a plastic bag with ripe fruit, and we set off on our journey across the small Caribbean island in search of musicians he hadn’t seen in years. On the way, we shared stories in broken French and English, stopping at truck stops to eat delicious fried fish. Robert took me to his hometown, and placed a mango and a flower on the grave of his teacher and mentor, a local poet. The seeds of Vwayajé (Traveller) were sewn on this trip, but shortly after returning home, I heard that Robert was ill, and he sadly passed away in 2018. This compilation was originally intended as a way to share Robert’s brazen work with a wider global audience, but it now also serves to immortalize his indomitable spirit. Gwakasonné is the ecstatic articulation of Robert Oumaou’s artistic and political vision, a unified expression of his interests in American jazz, pre-colonial rhythms, Guadeloupian independence, and Créole poetics. Over the course of three albums, all released in the 80s, Robert piloted a revolving cast of musicians, a venerable who’s-who of Point-a-Pitre avant-jazz pioneers, to deftly intone his creative communal concepts. The songs on Vwayajé are compiled from these three releases, Gwakasonné, Temwen, and Moun, along with an electronic mantra taken from his 2007 solo album Sang Comment Taire. Viewed from our current artistic and cultural landscape, Robert’s work is exceptionally enduring, grounded in its declarations of freedom and foundational use of the Ka (drum) and voice, and prescient in its borderless explorations of protest folk, electronics, ambient atmosphere, music from the African diaspora, and spiritual jazz. The long-form hive-mind expression of the group has parallels with similar explorations by The Grateful Dead, electric Miles, Pharaoh Sanders, and even the Boredoms, but these are only oblique references for a truly peerless sound. Like other conceptual children of Gérard Lockel, the group was part of a progressive movement of like-minded musicians, such as Serge Fabriano, Dao, Erick Cosaque, and Gaoulé Mizik, who embraced Lockel’s modernist ideals, fusing Gwo Ka drumming and tuning systems with contemporary jazz and vanguard recording technologies. Robert’s ecstatic phrasings, embrace of electronic instruments, and daring lyrics set the group apart as the beatific expression of a sagacious soul.” less"

At age 18, she hitchhiked across the US, arriving at the Olympic National Rainforest in Washington State where, in an off-the-grid cabin with an old upright piano, she began weaving pop and folk sounds with her classical training. Maggie soon started performing in Seattle alongside veteran musicians who introduced her to R&B and jazz. Her writing and performing style continued to evolve with these new influences. Eventually the Northwest’s gloomy weather propelled her further west, to Hawaii, where she has made her home ever since and continues to record and perform today. On these songs, Maggie shows the soulful side of her jazzy chops over two mid tempo groovers that live somewhere in the great sweet spot between AOR and modern soul, with jazz as the foundation. Recorded right before the advent of the digital era, the organic grooves of her band lay the foundation for her impressive vocal range that she is taking to great heights at the end of the A-side.\" less"

   "name": "Brilliant collaborative debut album of riveting noise and widescreen synths by Merzbow and Posh Isolation’s Vanity Productions featuring two longform, elemental works transmuting worries about ecological disaster into a torrent of spirit-gnawing, experimental noise that surpasses the sum of its parts. Masami Akita and Christian Stadsgaard both hail from places with a lot of coastline vulnerable to sea level rises, ‘Coastal Erosion’ sees them grasp the nettle of impending doom with typically gauntleted grip and an unswerving intensity that speaks to clear and present concerns. While perhaps not the most obvious bedfellows for collaboration, the artists patently share an emphatic empathy for the situation that resonates through their music, where human forces of emotion intersect elemental chaos in a pair of poetically tempestuous, even harrowing works. Merzbow’s visceral, primal roar sustains a perpetual force of attrition that constantly threatens to overwhelm VP’s widescreen, panoramic pads on both of the LP’s monolithic tracts. But it’s due to their democracy of vision that they speak as one, rather than over each other. On the A-side’s 18 minute ‘Erosion Japan’ they connote the frothing might of the Pacific tide encroaching and destroying towering walls of steel and glass with an arrestingly Ballardian quality to their instrumental description of violence and anguish. The B-side’s 17 minute ‘Erosion of Denmark’ follows with a more pensive arrangement of low-lying, unyielding drone frequencies smeared to stereo extremes and overlapped with spirit-penetrating shards of distortion, limning the prospective submergence of the Danish peninsula and its archipelagoes with a Thunbergian seriousness and intractable logic. Taken as a profound warning or as an elegy for anthropocene extinction, ‘Coastal Erosion’ is a frighteningly powerful statement that leaves its message like the murky stain of flood waters inside the mind. less"

Biblical in concept and scale, ‘The Jericho Records’ takes the world’s oldest, longest inhabited city as muse for a incredible showcase of futurist/primitive rhythm and sound, melding Michael’s trademark so-stiff-it’s-fuucking-funky-as-fuck drum patterns with a much broader range of instrumentation and voices than any previous AM release. To get down to business, DJs and dancers need to clock the highlights in the cataclysmic shock of ‘Twelve Stones to Divide Jordan’s Sand’, as well as the bare-faced rage of ‘The House of Rahab’, the searing ‘Crack and Collapse In The Storm of Lights’, and the incendiary payload of ‘Omen’s Duty’ or the appearance of Prurient on the trampling thunder of ‘Walking on Cursed Soil’. But we’d be remiss to overlook the moments of contrast in the Arabic EBM mutation of ‘Array The Troops’ featuring synths from Regis; the Muslimgauze-like meld of whirling percussion and horns in ‘The City Awakes’; or the clashing scimitars of ‘Swordplay’; while ‘The Seven Shofars’ and ‘In Silence’ impressively attest to AM’s unrepentant obsession with darkest, ritual ambient electronics.

Throwing electroacoustic conventions overboard, Andrew Wilson (Andras) and John Tanner (Eleventeen Eston) recorded this new work aboard a 1950s riverboat with a resourceful array of weatherproof electronic instruments and a long extension lead. These eight compositions pull in a by-catch of maritime folklore; of Siren and Selkie, Seagull and engine oil slick. A change of course from their debut album 69 (Growing Bin Records, 2016), the ambient temperature drops as II casts out to sea in uncertain weather and returns to the safe harbours of Port Phillip Bay. The seafarers head out to My Gull’s poised optimism. The birds watch but do they listen? By the arrival of Loch and Key, the shoreline has dissolved completely, the boat floating in serene infinity as the rest of the world spins. Conditions soon take a treacherous turn on Killcord Pts I-III - a 12 minute odyssey that battens down the hatches as these sailors eye merciless waves and blinding ocean spray, jointly channelling Berlin-school electronics and sea legs. In the aftermath, the waterlogged bleeps of Idle survey the damage as our parched crew sound the distress signal and ultimately descend into delirium. Known for navigating individual courses as solo musicians, Wilson and Tanner’s collective storytelling is saturated in detail, buoying between tension and harmony. II modestly stands as some of both artists’ most accomplished material.” less"

The first in a series of vinyl reissues, this one features three 2010-2011 tapes: ‘Byzantine Private CIA’, ‘Mural of Saddam’, and ‘Yemeni Commandos’, remastered and repackaged with new artwork - essential picks for disciples of Muslimgauze, Prurient, Shackleton!!! Arriving under a shroud of anonymity in 2010 with the four tracks of ‘Byzantine Private CIA’, Vatican Shadow has since become one of the most vital projects manned by Dominick Fernow (Prurient, Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement, Christian Cosmos, Exploring Jezebel), daring to grasp the nettle of US geopolitics, hijacking imagery and text from a plethora of news articles, books and government publications, and using them to adorn and title his all-instrumental productions. He recontextualised U.S. foreign policy in a way that recalls how original industrial, noise and post-punk mutants used their art and music to express feelings towards the cold war and western socio-economics during the late ‘70s and thru the ‘80s - with a particular, explicit thread of inspiration coming from Bryn Jones’ prolific Muslimgauze catalogue. The first two sides of the 2LP include all four cuts from Vatican Shadow’s first release, ‘Byzantine Private CIA’, taking in the cold thuds and clamouring background noise of ‘Deny Military Involvement’ alongside highlights in the militant trample of ‘Cairo Sword Unsheathed’ and the sludgy industrial dirge of ‘Gunman With Silencer’. The third and fourth side follow with three tracks off ‘Mural of Saddam’, including the brittle, Muslimgauze-like stepper ‘Schwarzkopf Arc of Triumph’, and the furtive trip hop of ‘U.S. M1A1 Abrams Exhaust Rises Between The Hands Of Victory’, before concluding with some the project’s most sublime work in the opiated lushness of ’Shadow War In Yemen’ and ‘Asymmetric Warfare Studies Group Double Game’ from the ‘Yemeni Commandos’ tape. less"

   "name": "Ancient sounding folk music and Soviet songs from south of Russia, in the only region of Europe where Buddhism is the most practiced religion. “In early November 2014 we went to Kalmykia. Our goal was the local “Dzhangar” epic. The epic genre, as one of the most archaic, can be called a basis for Kalmyk music culture. Not so long time ago among Kalmyks there were their own professional epic storytellers - Dzhangarchi who as a socio-artistic institute today are practically absent: repertoire of modern folk singers mostly consists of late folk art of the Soviet era. But as usual in our search we did not ignore these more recent forms of traditional music that allowed us to find very valuable material. One week spent in Kalmykia was filled with meetings and record sessions. And, as we see it, the most interesting and the richest one was the day spent in the village of Bulgun (officially known as Troitskoe). We met up with Maria Beltsikova and Tatiana Dordzhieva in this village. The energetic and charismatic grand mammas are winners of various music competitions, in the recent past they have been frequent guests of national holidays and official events. In addition both of them are self-taught grown up in conditions of respect for traditions. On the day of our meeting we were able to record more than twenty songs. In the repertoire of Maria and Tatiana there have been religious Buddhist songs, droning laments, ceremonial wedding songs, heroic ballads about Kalmyks in the Patriotic War 1812, and, of course, Soviet folklore. The songs of the “red” period was presented with a variety of songs: praising the Communist Party and workers of the collective farms and songs about the deportation of Kalmyks in 1943-1944. Tatiana and Maria know well this period of time - with their own bitter experience: with their relatives and neighbors they were deported to Siberia. Also this album contains several songs composed by Tatiana Dordzhieva. In addition to the a-capella performance, in some of the songs you can hear traditional Kalmyk dombra playing. Maria Beltsikova is the person playing this instrument.” less"

Rosalía Vila Tobella is already something of a sensation in her native Spain, but this new album looks certain to propel her into the stratosphere with its immediately accessible but multi-layered fusion of traditional flamenco with the swagger of modern R&B, a kind of minimal pop variant underpinned by what feels like an almost endless succession of clever hooks. The opening Malamente is the most immediate and hard-hitting of the 11 tracks here, but the album is basically wall-to-wall brilliance, from the subtle, almost Theo-parrish inspired EQ cuts on Que No Salga La Luna to the super fwd juxtaposition of flamenco, auto-tune, pulsing subs and motorbikes revving on De Aquí No Sales to the ultra-ohrwurm Di Mi Nombre. Even the more traditional a cappela tracks edge into deviance - the eerie, layered vocals on A Ningún Hombre closing the album on a nervy, uncompromising note. El Mal Querer really is a perfectly formed, hyper-modern vision of pop music; structurally daring, endlessly catchy, melancholy, introspective, bursting with charisma and more ideas than any other record we’ve listened to in 2018. Apparently there’s new music in the works from Rosalía with Pharell and Arca, you should keep a v close eye on this one... less"

All skilled players and composers, the Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza were formed in 1964 at the initiative of Franco Evangelisti with an aesthetic agenda looking beyond the boundaries of previous improvisational musics. They focussed on production and the qualities of sound itself, employing innovative recording and playing techniques at the limits of their capabilities as performers and composers in order to discover the \"new consonance\" inferred in their nomenclature. These ten pieces spanning eight years are highly considered works of art, aware of the Neo-Dadaists attempts to disassemble the concept of a work of art, and instead attempting to expand its parameters as a transitory body of work in flux. We can hear traces of this work reflected in the more forward thinking Italian film soundtracks of the era and to a further extent, in Ennio Morricone's work for Hollywood, in turn casting an influence over much exploratory, non-academic contemporary music. less"

Strongly percussive and melodic, synth-driven dance music sharing roots with the Principé label’s kuduro styles - tip!!! “Synthesize the Soul, Ostinato Records’ second compilation, revealed chapter one of the Cabo Verde cultural story in Europe, zooming in on visionaries like Paulino Vieira who made Lisbon the headquarters spearheading the musical revolution taking place within Cape Verdean emigre communities across Europe in the 1980s. Musicians from across the diaspora would eagerly travel to the Portuguese capital to record. Grupo Pilon represents the second chapter of the Krioulu diaspora story. In smaller pockets, second generation musicians were independently contributing to one of the most lush periods of cultural innovation by immigrants in Europe. In Luxembourg, in 1986, a group of teenagers formed the largely unknown (outside of Cape Verdean circles) but consistently brilliant band named after the blunt instrument used in the islands to pound corn for Cabo Verde's national dish, cachupa. With only five members, Pilon combined searing estilo Krioulu drumming and the hybrid ColaZouk style with blissful synth work and rugged guitar licks, creating a stripped-down, addictive sound that masterfully straddled two worlds. The band drew from the inspiring political changes of the day: the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The right to democracy became a constant theme in Pilon’s songs. With access to better opportunities than their parents’ generation, Pilon’s roster were part time musicians. Music was not part of their academic upbringing nor a full-time gig. Their rhythm and style were wonderfully imperfect, made out of rawer skills and inexperience. Pilon did not follow the templates established by revered Cabo Verde bands. Keyboard player Emilio Borges played off beat and the band preferred arranging their songs to start from the beat normally heard in the middle of a composition rather than the beginning. These two elements made Pilon’s music simple, unique, and inimitable. This LP, drawing from the six most powerful songs from Pilon’s three-album catalog, is the serving of still fresh leite quente to spice the summer and maybe even fuel the next generation of musicians in the Krioulu corners of Europe. Pilon are back in the studio refining their sound to revive their journey that looked all but lost to the world's ears two decades ago.” less"

   "name": "Avant-garde composer and student of La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela and Jung Hee Choi, Ellen Arkbro renders sustained and harmonically opaque chords on her stunning second solo album for Subtext. More minimal and extended than her 2017 debut ‘For Organ and Brass’, 'Chords’ is a focussed study in a gradual manipulation of acoustic timbres, using subtle synthesis of organ and guitar through two extended pieces bound to generate uncanny sensations to anyone familiar with the conventional tone of her chosen instruments. Although underpinned by mathematical rigour, Arkbro draws direct connections to sacred music through a strict method of reduction, stripping away elements in a process she likens to a sculptor chipping away at stone. What’s left is primed for a kind of mind-altering osmosis, where the listener gradually fills in the gaps, or as she tells the most recent issue of The Wire “…what you pay attention to will change what you hear”. Influenced by her teachers and the spirit of New York’s 1960’s Downtown scene, Arkbro is meticulous in her process and use of unusual tunings to reveal strange, sustained sounds that seem to continuously change shape. This pursuit of a kind of sonic “emptiness” belies the often unearthly spatial dimensions she manages to conjur, making highly perception-based sounds that have an almost supernatural quality. The results sit somewhere between sacred and industrial music, a listening experience with highly meditative, spiritual, sometimes disturbing qualities - quite a remarkable achievement. less"

A strong tip to fans of work by Caterina Barbieri, Emptyset, Sarah Davachi. Arriving in the resonating wake of her self-released solo début Velocity of Sleep [2017], and flanked by the recently issued Organ Dirges 2016-2017 tape for Ascetic House, the Cast Of Mind LP gently but grandly expands the constellation of Kali Malone's solo releases, next to her Upper Glossa collaborations with Caterina Barbieri, a tape with Ellen Akrbro, and acclaimed live performances. Joined by Yoann Durant (Alto Sax), Isak Hedtjärn (Bass Clarinet), Gabriella Varga Kalsson (Bassoon), and Mats Äleklint (Trombone), Kali’s Buchla 200 Synthesiser forms the basis for a quartet of diaphanous and slowly unfolding electro-acoustic landscapes that externalise a highly personalised form of emotive topography. In the titular opener, wood and brass trace the swooning ellipses of Kali’s Buchla contours in stately procession suggesting a sort of resigned march to battle, before the Buchla appears to dominate in the warped streaks of Bondage To Formula, but listen closer and it’s harder to tell whether it’s electronic or organic sources so fully lending flesh to her rich sound field. The answer to that question is much clearer in Arched To Hysteria, whose keening, hunched electronic forces hold powerful potential to conversely induce paranoia and heavily hypnagogic effects, whilst Empty The Belief yields a lustrous, Raga-like drone capturing a marriage of Buchla and bassoon at their most transcendent and steeply attractive.

   "name": "Enchanting studies in 17th Century Italian baroque classicism, presenting Michel Samson’s first published recording since his unparalleled work with Albert Ayler in the late ‘60s, fulfilling a longheld dream of Sean McCann’s Recital to “publish an album that gives reverence to his violin playing” “The collection on this LP holds numerous 17th-Century works of the Italian baroque, performed by Michel Samson and his wife, Rebecca. It showcases some of the earliest music composed for the violin as a featured soloist. Rebecca accompanies on a replica – believed to be the only extant replica in the United States – of the claviorganum, a rare and curious instrument that traces back to the 15th century. Comprised of both an organ and a harpsichord integrated into a single case, the claviorganum harkens to a time of experimentation and artistry of design. Michel’s violin was made by Francesco Gobetti in 1718; its sound carries beautifully throughout the room. Samson worked as a dealer of rare and antique violins for many years, and has an ear for majestic craftsmanship. The style adopted by Italian composers during the baroque was one of heightened lyricism, emotion, and ornamentation, especially when voiced through the violin; it is no accident that Michel’s unique approach to articulation and intonation speaks both to the present and the past. In these recordings you can hear the same joy dripping across the strings, as in his days with Ayler. It shows what beauty can be instilled inside someone. Rebecca’s playing is exquisite, too, complimenting each movement as they fold on. Please enjoy this special album. Sean McCann [with contributions by Sarah Davachi], April 2019” less"

Sounds of liberation were at the forefront of avant-garde black expression in the early 1970s, putting action behind their creative endeavors. they were as much of a community force as a band, and because of that there was a strong desire by the entire group to work with a range of different populations, from school children to inmates. they continued to do so throughout the mid-1970s. The group issued one self-released album, new horizons – alternately titled the sounds of liberation in later pressings – in 1972, on their dogtown label. [it was reissued earlier this decade to a great deal of fanfare amongst jazz fans, by porter records.] In addition to club performances, the collective initiated happenings in elementary schools, prisons & community centers throughout philadelphia, to great success and impact in the city’s african-american and jazz community. by 1973 the band – along with their manager, george gilmore (father of r & b musician linc gilmore, of breakwater fame) – travelled to new york city for a recording session at columbia university. This five-song session of original music (with compositions penned by jamal, lancaster and sudler) has never been released and has been prepared for this important and long-overdue lp package by group members, in collaboration with brewerytown beats records in philadelphia.

The two sides contrast in their approach and appeal. On side A’s ‘The Difference of Similarity’ the music feels haunted and fractal, as though caught in a k-hole or like sleepwalking a creaky stately home, with keys wilting in the manner of The Caretaker’s music, and blown around long, wide, moonlit corridors before this playfulness contracts into colder, frozen stasis and pinched microtonal frequencies. By contrast the B-side’s ‘The Similarity of Difference’ is much brighter, allowing the keys to ring out in stumbling flights and flurries diffracted in mid-air by Tricoli’s spindly fingers on the Revox, putting his Jérôme Noetinger-styled chops to nearly imperceptible yet psychedelic use.

The archive series will present pieces which can be considered as completed works rather than unfinished fragments, and ‘ARC 1’ is a fittingly contemplative artefact - preserving Mika’s patient, sensuous minimalism released under his solo moniker, Ø. Made up of two selections from an untitled recording Vainio did as Ø for the radio project Ambient City at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1994, the 34 minute work can be considered a complete, singular work, and one of the purest in Vainio's catalogue. Working at the threshold of perception in a way comparable with fellow minimalist masters such as Eliane Radigue or Kevin Drumm, ‘ARC 1’ follows a glacial transition from elemental subbass pulses through sustained, hovering drone before almost imperceptibly changing state half way, when a field of static disruption re-organises the piece’s atoms, only for the noise to recede and reveal a more complex timbral aurora, and a final tract of isolationist ambience flickering like northern lights. less"

   "name": "Tokyo’s Hosanna Anniversary lands this fruity jazz house session in the same week as his ace, exploratory album for Andy Lyster’s Youth In two parts he gets loose like Jamal Moss on a kicking Chi groove, running skudgy acid lines and jazzy riffs over Part 1, then accentuating the gritty, muscular bassline in ‘Hakkenden II’. \"If you listen carefully to the first piece, “Hakkenden I”, the first thing you will notice is how the lead electric piano line and repetitive electronic motifs – known in colloquial slang as “acid lines” – follow the same melodic pattern, as if Hoshina Anniversary was sending the same powerful psychokinetic instructions to a number of instruments at the same time.In contrast, “Hakkenden II” is darker and more hallucinogenic in tone. The use of restless, arpeggio-style bass and creepy-sounding chord sequences suggest that Hoshina Anniversary momentarily lost control of his psychokinetic powers before wresting back the initiative as the recording progressed (the return of the melodies and instrumentation heard in “Hakkenden I” in the second half of the piece supports these findings).\" less"

   "name": "Creepy as f**k dark ambient and slithering rhythms from London’s Roberto Crippa on cult Italian industrial label; Second Sleep. Continuing the pursuit of a charred, abstract electronic muse found on his LPs for Portals Editions and We Can Elude Control, Crippa’s 3rd release masterfully manipulates listeners into a hypnagogic, primordial state of mind thru a process of patiently purposeful dematerialisation. Sounding like a mulched Mika Vainio work or Shapednoise on quaaludes, Crippa’s ‘Ascent’ either appears to enact a sisyphean struggle or even simply give up at the start, and proceed to circle whatever it was intending to ascend. The results remain low lying and even face down in the murk, melting out into rivulets of gravelly rhythm and muddy texture. But there’s a dark romance in this collapse of the senses, relishing a sensuousness that perhaps only comes after synapses are bombed out from excessive drink and drugz, or whatever takes you there, where thoughts, like Crippa’s music, flow effluent and iridescent, bubbling up strangely pleasant feelings from the dank to intensify your end times wallow. less"

   "name": "Epically narrative-driven IDM/electronica from Canada’s Antwood on his 3rd LP for Planet Mu “Tristan has always used conceptual frameworks to facilitate the writing process and ‘Delphi’ is no exception. This time Tristan worked with his girlfriend Olivia Dreisinger to develop a fictional character: the young lovelorn Delphi. She is represented throughout by a recurring melody, with the album developing the story around her. Deeper than this however, ‘Delphi’ represents the hurdles faced by modern lovers, and those felt personally by Tristan, as the album encompasses a wide range of his emotions. The character ’Delphi’ finds solace in escaping to a place, her namesake, the ancient Greek city. She gets lost in her fantasy, realising it is not as she had idealised. “Olivia and I started making the album cover as soon as I knew what direction ‘Delphi’ was headed in. I took objects that had significance to me at the time of production and physically recreated them as “Delphi world” objects, so that the album’s narrative and each track are represented in the cover photo. If you flip the album over, there is a computer rendering by Paulin Rogues of the two landmarks in the ancient city of Delphi - not quite ancient or modern Delphi, somehow real life but also fantastical.” Delphi is an album where the real and the fantastic combine, where functional club music meets evocative piano miniatures. “I ended up working on ‘Delphi’ for over a year, where it developed and grew in parallel to my own life. It became story-like, and I embraced the story-like quality of it.” Perhaps the story of ‘Delphi’ is the story of our own lives.” less"

   "name": "Rarely has an album owed so much to production... Low return with their most daring, experimental release in years, co-produced by James Blake's man at the controls B.J. Burton, at times verging on a layered, pulsing electronic sound you'd associate with the likes of Andy Stott. Doused in distortion, throbbing electronics, submerged vocals, side-chain effects - this could easily have been a nauseating exercise in modernisation; but instead the strength of the songwriting shines through for one of Low's best = a standout full-length for 2018. \"In 2018, Low will turn twenty-five. Since 1993, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker—the married couple whose heaven-and-earth harmonies have always held the band’s center—have pioneered a subgenre, shrugged off its strictures, recorded a Christmas classic, become a magnetic onstage force, and emerged as one of music’s most steadfast and vital vehicles for pulling light from our darkest emotional recesses. But Low will not commemorate its first quarter-century with mawkish nostalgia or safe runs through songbook favorites. Instead, in faithfully defiant fashion, Low will release its most brazen, abrasive (and, paradoxically, most empowering) album ever: Double Negative, an unflinching eleven-song quest through snarling static and shattering beats that somehow culminates in the brightest pop song of Low’s career. To make Double Negative, Low reenlisted B.J. Burton, the quietly energetic and adventurous producer who has made records with James Blake, Sylvan Esso, and The Tallest Man on Earth in recent years while working as one of the go-to figures at Bon Iver’s home studio, April Base. Burton recorded Low’s last album, 2015’s Ones and Sixes, at April Base, adding might to many of its beats and squelch and frisson beneath many of its melodies. This time, though, Sparhawk, Parker, and bassist Steve Garrington knew they wanted to go further with Burton and his palette of sounds, to see what someone who is, as Sparhawk puts it, “a hip-hop guy” could truly do to their music. Rather than obsessively write and rehearse at home in Duluth, Minnesota, they would often head southeast to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, arriving with sketches and ideas that they would work on for days with Burton. Band and producer became collaborative cowriters, building the pieces up and breaking them down and building them again until their purpose and force felt clear. As the world outside seemed to slide deeper into instability, Low repeated this process for the better part of two years, pondering the results during tours and breaks at home. They considered not only how the fragments fit together but also how, in the United States of 2018, they functioned as statements and salves. Double Negative is, indeed, a record perfectly and painfully suited for our time. Loud and contentious and commanding, Low fightsfor the world by fighting against it. It begins in pure bedlam, with a beat built from a loop of ruptured noise waging war against the paired voices of Sparhawk and Parker the moment they begin to sing during the massive “Quorum.” For forty minutes, they indulge the battle, trying to be heard amid the noisy grain, sometimes winning and sometimes being tossed toward oblivion. In spite of the mounting noise, Sparhawk and Parker still sing. Or maybe they sing because of the noise. For Low, has there ever really been a difference?\" less"

   "name": "Recorded at Mills College in 1977, Robert Ashley’s iconic Private Parts has remarkably never been officially reissued on vinyl since its first pressing in 1978 - until now. Ashley was a pioneer of the American avant-garde, member of the Sonic Arts Union (alongside David Behrman, Alvin Lucier, and Gordon Mumma), the director of the San Francisco Tape Music Center and eventually the Mills College for Contemporary Music where Private Parts was recorded. Despite his interest in experimental techniques, often modulating his voice beyond recognition, on Private Parts Ashley discovered that his own, untreated voice carried its own transfixing qualities. Split into two 20 minute pieces (one told from the perspective of a man, the other of a woman), Ashley narrates a philosophically rich, often absurd, mysteriously opaque quasi stream-of-consciousness, weaving around slowly unfurling keyboard and tabla ragas played by Krishna Bhatt and Gene Tyranny. “This is not a record, this is a story…” he tells us not long into ‘The Park’, before referencing Alvin Lucier’s “I am sitting in a room”, recorded a decade earlier - a piece famously concerned with frequencies and resonance. Was Ashley dismissing his formative tape music life, or merely producing a new kind of acoustic sleight of hand? Hard to tell, but in any event, these recordings marked a distinct new phase in his recording career; from this point on he became best known for that uniquely meditative, untreated voice. Ashley had previously worked at the University of Michigan's Speech Research Laboratories, so it’s not a stretch to assume that his focus on ‘Private Parts’ was as much about tonality as narrative, but in any event, the impact of Private Parts was substantial, eventually adapted for television by Channel 4 in the UK (as part of Ashley’s seven-part opera Perfect Lives), but also carrying through an obvious stylistic influence on everyone from Laurie Anderson to David Byrne’s Talking Heads. Over 40 years on, Private Parts has lost none of its potency. It’s a record that operates on multiple levels; it opens a portal into a curious narrative wormhole, but also triggers dizzying, gradual hypnosis. It makes you think of the deep, mysterious but also absurd minutiae of life - something that’s now most commonly (and far too often) referred to as Lynchian - in a way you’re unlikely to experience with any other record. And you’re unlikely to experience it in quite the same way more than once. less"

Hecker’s processing here moves in veiled ways, soft refractions and whispered shrouds woven within improvisational sessions of traditional gagaku interplay, evoking a sense of vaulted space, temples at dawn, shredded silk fluttering in the rafters. This is boldly barren music, skeletal and sculptural, shaped from wood, wind, strings, and mist. Modern yet ancient, delicate and desolate, Anoyo inverts its predecessor to compellingly conjure a parallel world of illusion, solitude, and eternal return.\" less"

   "name": "Kevin Martin has tapped into a kind of unfathomable strain of desolation this year, first on King Midas Sound’s ‘Solitude’ - one of the most painfully lonely albums of recent times, and now on the first album under his own name, ’Sirens’, released by Lawrence English’s Room 40 label. It’s a startling record lost in its own thoughts, the soundtrack to personal tragedy and rebirth somehow mirroring Hildur Gudnadottir’s recent score work for Chernobyl, but in much more personal space. Despite being a more or less constant presence on our radars since the late 90’s when we first opened our doors (actually, from way before that - 1995’s 'Macro Dub Infection' comp and 97’s 'Köner Experiment' are both foundational records here) - and despite a constant barrage of bangers under myriad guises (but mostly as The Bug), various strains of Martin's work seem to have only just recently converged into something entirely distinctive. Both ’Solitude’ and ’Sirens’ are neither showy nor self indulgent - this is music that’s ice cold yet intimate, barely-there - but utterly compelling. While its easy to make sudden impact with scudding basslines, here Martin takes a more lonely route into numerous strands of contemporary music; from dub to noise and across the abyss between, into a dimly lit corner that somehow brings out the best we’ve heard from him in over 20 years. It's nothing short of an isolationist classic. “When I was 22 I managed to acquire Techno Animal’s Demonoid 12” at a local record store, Rocking Horse Records. I can still recall the intensities of sound that marked the first moments of listening to it. The sense of bass as a tactile surface, that rolling groove and the howling sine waves and dub sirens that scorched with a type of sonic burning sensation that to this day makes my hairs stand on end. A year later I heard Ice’s Bad Blood, from there I discovered The Bug through a release on Wordsound, a band called God, a sound movement called isolationism and much more; all of these projects had one nexus point - Kevin Richard Martin. In 2015, Kevin and I book-ended a series of concerts at Berghain for CTM festival. For his performance, Kevin debuted a new work I’d heard very little about called ’Sirens’. I remember two things distinctly about the performance. The first thing is he opened the set with a blazing passage of bass and dub sirens that instantly transported me back to those initial moments of encountering his work. The second was the feeling of absolute, crushing bass. Not before, or since, have I felt a sense of sound pressure like this. Unlike his other work with The Bug for example, the consistent bass carrying in the space was literally breathtaking and there were moments when it seemed difficult to see clearly as my eye sockets were vibrating in a way I’d never experienced. Sirens, which documents the intensities surrounding the delivery and early days of his first child, carries in it a sense of deep affect. The album, unlike the live work, traces out a dynamic sound world that is both tender and caustic. It charts the emotional rollercoaster that is the arrival of parenthood, heightened through the complex circumstances of his wife's emergency procedures during the birth and two further life threatening operations for his son, in the first month of the child's life. Within each piece, microcosms of sensation unfold, Kevin clearly and deftly manoeuvres us through the tumultuous journey. Seconds become hours, and hours become seconds; Sirens somehow creates a sense of time that is without anchor and is foggy in a way that is profoundly unique (and frankly pleasurable). Kevin Richard Martin has remained a point of constant inspiration for me over several decades now. To have the opportunity to share his first ever solo recording, one that arguably opens an entirely new side of his practice, brings me the utmost pride. His work has impacted so very much on me at various points and I know I am not alone in this situation. His new work, Sirens is a life journey transposed into sound that is truly personal, but effortlessly universal. It is the start of a new chapter for Kevin and one that I know will only strengthen his place as one of the critical voices in contemporary electronic music. Lawrence English, March 2019” less"

OG copies are known to trade for $700 on the 2nd hand market and it ain’t hard to hear why - this is street funk gold! “Few creative geniuses epitomize the Tabansi label’s broad-stroke approach to music than the late Nkono Teles. Cameroun-born and Nigeria-bred, this innovative multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer and engineer was one of a select handful of backroom boffins that West African artists and producers would habitually call upon when they wanted a ‘modernist’ Afro-pop sound that would appeal across borders. A pioneer of electronics in African music, Nkono Teles was equally at home with synthesisers, drum machines, guitar effects and computer programming as traditional instruments. One of West Africa’s most prolific producers during the 1980s, Teles is credited with more than 150 productions, spanning the work of more than 100 artists and groups. Of Nkono Teles’ three solo-artist LPs, ‘Party Beats’ is, by far, the most innovative and characteristic. He plays all instruments, and was apparently always the first to admit that singing wasn’t his forte; hence the utilization of an eleven-piece choral section! The raw electronic effects used here have always been sought-after by breaks and hip hop producers as well as DJs, with original copies of Party Beats regularly changing hands for anything up to $700.” less"

   "name": "Eighteen months since their first issue, Woe To The Septic Heart!'s long delayed 2nd release finally dawns upon us. Comprising entirely new and previously unreleased Shackleton material - including collaborations with vocalist Vengeance Tenfold and musical spars Andreas Gerth (Tied & Tickled Trio) and Kingsuk Biswas (Bedouin Ascent) - it's also his most shocking and invigorating body of work. What strikes us first and foremost is the newfound vitality and visceral impact of his sound here. Any signature murk is replaced with a lysergic lucidity and rendered in widescreen 3D that consumes the senses with ultra-vivid potential. The CD entitled 'Music For The Quiet Hour' features your venerated protagonist and his mystical interpreter, Vengeance Tenfold in the extended format we've long wished to hear them, astral projecting cut-up passages of Tenfold's apocalypse-baiting text over five meticulously crafted sonic topographies which stretch to the periphery of the mind's eye and ever further into inky blackness. This combination of poetry/spoken word and dark ambience clearly calls to mind Deathprod's 'Reference Frequencies', but the choking bass pressure and timbral cadence are innately Shackleton, just presented in a vital new form. But, perhaps the most subtle yet striking new element is the wheezing, scaling tonal spectrum siphoned through the Italian drawbar organ module which inspired the title of 'The Drawbar Organ EPs'. Effectively forming an album in their own right, it's here that we find more condensed, rhythmically structured episodes reminding of his recent live shows - which are, in our humble opinion, the finest in the world right now. Meditating on late '60s/early '70s Reich-ian rhythm phasing, stained with carmine Italian horror vibes, driven by wanton Junglist and post-punk torque and enveloped by a universal consciousness alluding to Alice Coltrane, it will take longer than we have right now for these tracks to settle in fully, but we can assure you that they're of the rarest, most precious substance.

More resolved and driven than 'Loop-Finding Jazz Records' (which appeared two years later), less reliant on glitch than Farben, it was essentially Jelinek's most satisfying and complete prototype for a new kind of sample-based music deeply immersed in the spirit of Jazz, without making any direct reference to it. Finally, 20 years later, here’s another chance for the unfamiliar to join the dots. Originally released via Move D’s Source imprint back in 1999, 'Personal Rock' is one of those albums that no one seems to ever talk about but which has resonated over the years with anyone lucky enough to have encountered it. Situated somewhere between 'Loop-Finding Jazz Records', his Farben output, Move D's Conjoint and Atom Heart's most immersive work for Rather Interesting, it's an album full of subtle production flourishes within deep House structures that belong to the pre-millenial IDM heyday, but which transcend its overly-fussy, masculine templates. The music is brooding and deep, designed for late night immersion without resorting to cliché, bolstered by what we reckon is the most forward thinking and timeless production of Jelinek’s output over the last two decades. Impossible to pull highlights, it’s an album best experienced from end-to-end through multiple listens, drawing you into a quietly euphoric, deep blue mood. Classic. less"

Recorded in Kingston, Jamaica for their own Equiknoxx Music label, ‘Eternal Children’ is the first time all 5 members have appeared on record together, with all three producers - Gavin “Gavsborg” Blair, Nick “Bobby Blackbird” Deane, and Jordan “Time Cow” Chung - cooking up for their vocalist Shanique Marie, alongside the ruder styles of regular spars, MC’s Kemikal and Alozade. As such the album expresses the collective’s shared experience both at home in sunny JA, as well as on the road and their 2nd home in Manchester, home to DDS but where they’re also keenly supported by an extended family including Swing Ting’s Balraj Samrai and MC Fox, plus DJ Jon K, and their mastering engineer Nick Sinna. The resulting 8-track album is a bounty of eclectic productions tweaked for good times. Cherry-picking from dancehall, hip hop and even pop ballads, they effortlessly balance experimental tendencies with classic forms in each song. Opener ’Solomon Is A Cup’ places Shanique Marie and Kemikal’s timeless, poetic storytelling in abstract sound design to absorbing effect, while two highlights ‘Brooklyn’, and the ear-worming hooks of ‘Manchester’, featuring Brent Bird and Swing Ting’s Fox, perfectly display the diversity of their bonds with the Caribbean diaspora. Listeners snagged on the weirdness of Equiknoxx’s DDS albums will probably want to head to the album’s more wayward productions; namely their dark, scudding ‘Corner’ and the percolated pearl of ‘Good Sandra’, complemented by the witty pen of Kemikal and Gavsborg, while it all comes together most soulfully with Shanique’s blazing delivery on the rugged bounce of ‘Move Along’ and her balmy pop-soul duet with Bobby Blackbird, ‘Rescue Me.’ less"

Patrice Rushen joined the Elektra / Asylum roster in 1978 as they launched a pop / jazz division alongside visionaries like Donald Byrd and Grover Washington, Jr. “The idea was to create music that was good for commercial radio / R&B,” Patrice explains. “We were all making sophisticated dance music, essentially.” Early classics like ‘Music Of The Earth’ and ‘Let’s Sing A Song Of Love’ were among Patrice’s first as a lead vocalist before her ‘Pizzazz’ album landed in 1979, featuring the unique disco of ‘Haven’t You Heard’ and one of her greatest ballads, ‘Settle For My Love’. Slick dancefloor anthem ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ and the ‘Posh’ album in 1980 led to her landmark album ‘Straight From The Heart’ two years later. Receiving little support from her label, Patrice and her production team personally funded a promo campaign for the first single from it, ‘Forget Me Nots’. It went on to peak at no. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the album was later Grammy-nominated, while the track became a timeless anthem and popular sample. Patrice’s final album for Elektra, ‘Now’ kept the bar high with sparse, synth-led songs including ‘Feel So Real’ and ‘To Each His Own’. It concluded a golden era creatively for Patrice which remains revered by soul and disco aficionados the world over. ‘Remind Me’ features all of Patrice Rushen’s chart singles, 12” versions and popular sample sources on one album for the first time.” less"

Highly recommended if yr into Félicia Atkinson, Huerco S, Leslie Winer... Born in St. Petersburg and based in Berlin, Alexandra Zakharenko aka Perila cut her teeth as in-house designer and programmer at the recently defunct Berlin Community Radio (BCR) before co-founding the Russian online station radio.syg.ma, as well as WET (Weird Erotic Tension), an online community exploring ideas of sonic sexuality in podcasts mixing spoken word, poetry, ASMR and field recordings. ‘Irer Dent’ stems directly from two WET podcasts, revolving around readings of an erotic novel and a collection of poems by Nat Marcus and Inger Wold Lund, each set to absorbingly hypnagogic backdrops, and both accompanied by quietly seductive, original instrumental works. In five parts the album traces a filigree line between reality and fantasy in a more literal way than the label’s previously all-instrumental releases. On ‘Nat’s Poems’ the voice of Nat Marcus regales a poetic account of Berlin nightlife woven with classic house lyrics from Rosie Gaines and Mr. White over 12 minutes of tumescent subbass and phosphorescing pads. Where sensuality is implied on that piece, it’s quietly explicit in the LP’s other vocal piece ‘Sweat’, which revolves around Inger Wold Lund recounting a dream about suppressed sexual desire in a hushed and unaffected manner amid a shimmering forcefield of spectral energy and meridian birdsong. Both pieces are complemented by extra subtle originals, including the barely-there, pink/purple hues of ‘Mouth Full of Tahini’ and the warm endorphin flush of ‘Message From Another Table.’ Slipping very sweetly into sferic’s liminal ambient space alongside Space Afrika, Echium and Jake Muir, ‘Irer Dent’ lends a distinct new shade of modern, adult, atmospheric emotion to the exploratory, Manchester-based label, answering a need for sincerity and intimacy in overwhelming times. less"

   "name": "Much needed reissue of Zé Eduardo Nazario’s killer 1982 Brazilian jazz fusion gem, crammed with amazing rhythms and properly taking flight into psychedelia on the stunning B-side. Perfect for warm weather and altered states of mind... “Zé Eduardo is a virtuoso drummer and percussionist with a prolific career as a musician and teacher. He was introduced to music in his youth and started playing professionally at the age of thirteen. In the late 60’s he was a regular at the famous Totem night club in São Paulo, where he performed alongside the pianist Tenório Jr. and other exceptional instrumentalists. Poema da Gota Serena was Zé Eduardo’s first solo project and it was financed by the legendary Lira Instrumental, a collaboration between the ground-breaking venue, label and publisher for the São Paulo avant-garde, Lira Paulistana, along with the always interesting Continental Records, home to such luminaries as Tom Zé. The album was offered as a package deal simultaneously with the production of “ Flor de Plástico Incinerada ”, ensuring 2 studio sessions at JV studios in October 1982. Each side of the album explores different duets which, with its suite formated tracks, give the album the feel of a cohesive whole. The first half of the A side, “ Energia dos Três Mundos” , is shared with the improvised saxophone of Cacau. Nazário delves into free jazz rhythms and plays his drums with a rolling and tumbling swing, using the kit in full, demonstrating the power of Brazilian jazz fusion. The second half of the suite takes us into a more tranquil mode. “ Só Prá Ouvir”, demonstrates Zé’s mastery on the glockenspiel, and Indian percussion instruments, such as the tabla and mridangam. Cacau, on his side, switches his saxophone for more delicate dancing flute driven passages, equal parts northeastern rhythms and deep Amazonian indigenous influences. The B side with “ Prá Pensar / Prá Sentir e Prá Contar” , contrasts heavily with the A side’s more organic and natural feel. In Prá Pensar Lelo Nazários’s synth clusters and electronic blasts strangely interact with the exploring, wandering percussion. This track leads into the sublime “ Prá Sentir e Prá Contar” where South Indian inspired vocals, performed by Zé Eduardo, accompany the graceful synth chords and fluttering percussion. The result is a hypnotic, otherworldly feel to the music that is infectious and takes the listener on an extraordinary journey.” less"

The album sees the duo expand upon the hazy mindset of last year’s debut EP across a flux of ambient interzones where they transmute fleeting, everyday feels into a bouquet of ephemeral and organically unresolved scenes. In an ambiguous style that has become key to West Mineral Ltd.’s aesthetic, the music is neither gloomy nor ecstatic but full of transitory sensations somewhere in between those poles. Each part feels pulled in multiple directions at once, resulting in a sublime schism between jazzy hustle and heavy-lidded electronics in ‘Item 1’, and a subtle underlying tension between layered dimensions of humid, dusky acoustics and congealed electronics on ‘Item 3’, while ‘Item 5’ dices with urges to dance/lean back, and ‘Item 10’ crystallises this idea of alchemic multivalency with an unmissable mix of fine grained mentasms firing like synaptic surges in iridescent grey matter. The expanded double album format also allows a greater variegation of their overgrown, verdant electronics and free rhythms in a gently perplexing style of ambient inception. Each of the ’11 Items’ feels like an exploration of dreams within dreams in a way that beautifully parses the poetic from the prosaic and cannily reflects a certain hyperaware yet hypnagogic state of modern ambient music. It evokes that feeling of friends in a room communicating non-verbally, or that babbling, forgot-what-I-was-talking-about flow between relaxed but frayed and buzzing minds. less"

   "name": "‘The Vanishing’ is a steeply beguiling album of electro-acoustic chicanery where endlessly inventive avant-garde icon Ambarchi meets longtime collaborator Martin Ng and Sydney’s new music performers, Ensemble Offspring In a mesmerising push and pull of acoustic and electronic sound, Ambarchi & Ng reprise their duo behind a trio of LPs c. 2000-2006, but newly augmented by new music specialists Ensemble Offspring, who instrumentally translate the pair’s guitar and turntable sketches into a disorienting play of extreme low end frequencies and hypertense, high register tightrope stunts. If you were keen for Ambarchi & O’Malley’s work on Alvin Lucier’s ‘Criss Cross’, the ‘Woods’ piece is a total knockout. “On the opening piece, the aptly named ‘Simulacrum I’, bowed violin harmonics mimic feedback tones & dispersed vibraphone attacks recall the glitching bell textures prominent in Ambarchi & Ng’s earlier work for electric guitar & turntable, which were themselves often uncannily reminiscent of acoustic sounds such as Tibetan prayer bowls. On ‘Woods’, two vibrating bass drums create an ominous landscape of rumbling tones that call to mind Ambarchi’s past work with abstract doom lords Sunn O))). Channelling giants of 20th century music such as Giacinto Scelsi & Luigi Nono, as well as contemporary composers like Klaus Lang, the restrained palette of strings & percussion present throughout the record creates a distinct sound world, yet each of the five pieces possesses its own compositional identity. On ‘Recife’ (arranged by Australian composer James Rushford), Ambarchi & Ng’s guitar & turntables join Ensemble Offspring for one of the record’s highlights, a delicate tapestry woven from subtly overlapping sonic events. Finally, the closing side-long title piece acts as the perfect summation of the record as a whole: beginning in silence, it builds into a densely buzzing texture of closely tuned harmonics before gently returning to the silence from which it came. Intended as the next step in a continuing project in which Ambarchi & Ng will go on to use these two LPs directly as part of their live performances, The Vanishing is a unique document of two artists reimagining the potential of their previous work, made possible through collaboration with a group of world-class musicians.” less"

   "name": "Cherry-picked soul, funk, R&B and astral jazz joints wrapped up in cosmic electronics and mythology. An expertly sequenced mix by Swiss DJ Sassy J, following online sessions for RA and Dekmantel and a 2014 tape for TTT “For the 13th mix in this series, Sassy J finds inspiration in the “Fruit of Life,” a system of information found in Sacred Geometry. It consists of a structure of 13 circles that is said to contain the blueprint of the universe. Its 13th circle is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the network and, more widely, the universe. It acts as a gateway to higher dimensions and a catalyst for healing. The music in this mix exudes spirituality. As a constructed piece, it’s a tapestry that weaves together broadcasts, interludes, songs, and poems. Echoes of horns mingle with a distant message of the cosmos as Sassy J invites us into a world from which we do not want to leave. Indeed, it doubles up as a map that marks Sassy J’s place in a universe that is held together by her singular thread. The overriding mantra of \"You gotta have freedom, you gotta have peace and love” marks the end of the musical journey and corresponds to the principle contained in the 13th sphere. It rings with poetic meaning and speaks to the values she espouses so uncompromisingly. What I have always admired most about Sassy J is her unwavering commitment to a musical vision. The music she invokes belongs to a Space Age of astral jazz explorations and sonic paths that lead to a higher state of consciousness. It is music that is born out of pain but which offers redemption; both serious and supremely uplifting. In the act of curation, Sassy J is proposing an alternative history, one where style isn't as important as leveraging meditative states and the spirit behind the sounds. Because Sassy J refuses to stay in one place and treats music as a set of recurring melodic shapes, the very texture of this mix is defined by transition, process, and flow. It seems to say that art is the only thing that exists beyond death. As a beam of sunshine floods through my window the music glistens out to the street beyond. Caught in a dance with the rays of sunlight, it reminds me of how music is a journey and a destination all of its own.” less"

   "name": "Sun Araw is the working title of a musical project helmed by Los Angeles-based artist Cameron Stallones. Sun Araw has released a number of well-received and consistently innovative albums, with his eighth, The Saddle of the Increate, released by Sun Ark Records (an imprint of Drag City) in 2017. \"In 2015 for the album Gazebo Effect, Mitchell Brown and I conceived a \"music system\" which would allow me to improvise with several instruments while running through a 1/4\" reel-to-reel tape machine that Mitchell was controlling and manipulating in realtime. The system we developed gives him the ability to dub pieces of my playing onto a repeating tape loop, sometimes allowing me to hear my playing before it's recorded, other times not. Sort of like playing an instrument into a wood-chipper. The general principle has held strong for years in our collaboration, although the equipment has been continually modified and optimised. The joy in this sort of setup is simple: mediated desire. The player makes a move, but what returns to the ears as audio is not quite the move that was made, it has been modified by the tape system. This is something that happens regularly in human experience: desire or will become modified by physics or the desire of another, and the difference between the original move and what \"returns\" holds a clue about the nature of the medium in which we find ourselves. Mitchell and I have found that mimicking this principle in our improvisational system continuously yields surprising and beautiful results, and makes us both better performers as we learn to adapt to and frolic with the medium in which we find ourselves. Longform music and the act of listening deeply are incredibly powerful tools for the modification of experience. Surface level attention acts sort of like a dog, it sniffs something, decides what it is, and kinda plods away looking for another smell. The best deep-listening music gently suggests, by weight of some sort of internal vibrancy, another, deeper return of the attention. Each subsequent return of the attention gives something back: at first just the energy that would have been spent wandering off, but before long a gentle glow can develop, and a sound that perhaps has not changed (say, in an Elaine Radigue monolith) now holds three extra colours that it didn't before. It's not long before looking deeper becomes its own reward, and soon bestows the most important quality of all: a distinct modification in the normal feeling of time, which is the harbinger of all the best sorts of human experiences.\" less"

Her collaborative album with Michael Tanner (Plinth) in 2016, with its quietly levitating drones pointed the way to her first solo record. \"My music usually evolves from a story, often about a place I've visited, enhanced by the help of the imagination. The story will develop while I improvise and immerse myself deeper and deeper into the piece, using a kind of tone painting to express this. Behind the Spider Web Gates draws inspiration from a house I happened upon in rural southern France last year. An imposing, dramatic, tall dark Gothic house with mysterious, black spider web-shaped gates at the entrance to the grounds. The piece is divided into three parts. The first part depicts the tranquil ascent up a rocky path surrounded by ancient woodland. A calm, minimal, single-noted drone on the viola is soon enhanced by layers of plainsong-style vocal chants. This is followed by the introduction of a melodic viola line symbolising the sound of bird song and nature which surrounds me. This phrase serves as a motif throughout the whole piece. The chime of the singing bowl represents the distant sound of church bells, being transported towards me by the wind. The second part brings into focus the ornate, looming Gothic spires of the house. The spider web gates are soon in clear view – and a sense of fear enters my subconscious mind. This is symbolised by the repetitive, menacing, single high note on the piano. The more serene vocal chants at this stage are placed to restore a sense of calm to the piece. A local had told me that the grounds were accessible to the public. My inquisitive mind tells me to open the spider web gates and enter the garden… For the third part of this piece, piercing viola harmonics denote my turning of the heavy, rusty handle of the huge, imposing gate. The single piano note is reintroduced, as the sense of fear within grows stronger. The melodic viola motif, which has been present throughout the piece, is now accompanied by a harmonium playing a haunting countermelody to further intensify this sense of foreboding. And as the large oak door to the Gothic house slowly creaks open, a new set of more chilling viola harmonics dramatically bring the piece to a close. For me, playing extended or deep listening music allows me more freedom to explore and improvise – a lack of time restriction opens up more possibilities. Due to the extended length, a recurring melody or motif can have more impact when reintroduced into the piece, surrounded by more space, and often triggers the emotions of the listener when it reappears. If I have lots of ideas before recording a long-form work, these can be presented more subtly and minimally to the listener as the piece unfolds – they can be more drawn out, painted on a larger canvas. There is also more space to introduce new textures and instruments without the piece becoming too busy. Focusing on longform music as a listener, as I become immersed in a piece I often also begin to hear background noises – such as distant lawnmowers in neighbours' gardens, car alarms or sirens in nearby streets – and subconsciously incorporate them in the piece I’m hearing. I've endeavoured to include similar types of sounds and drones into this piece and also hope that listeners will hear their own distant sounds – and that they might also become a part of my piece in their minds. I’d love that to happen.\" less"

   "name": "Kooky blends of chanson and crimped electronic grooves by underground french legend Ramuntcho Matta “The poet, producer and visual artist Ramuntcho Matta is coming back to music with 96. 96 – as 96 hours were needed to record this new album. Ramuntcho points out that behind this dazzling recording, years of experience enabled him to achieve the mix of spontaneity and intimacy of the album. He was the man behind the success of Eli Medeiros’ Toi mon toit. As a matter of fact, Ramuntcho Matta likes to put artists in the spotlight, as he has done with Brion Gysin, Don Cherry and many others. However this time he decided to put himself in the spotlight, with this record which sounds very 90s – with a wink to Bill Laswell for the bass – but still very contemporary. The album unveils a dark atmosphere, as if Bashung had lost himself in a Lynch film. Alongside the album release, Ramuntcho Matta and Akuphone have decided to make the entire discography of the artist available on Bandcamp. Each Friday since the beginning of this year, an album has been put online and made available for listening and downloading.” less"

Approaching ‘Tqaseem Mqamat El Haram’ we’re strongly reminded of the idea that “writing about music is like dancing to architecture.” In that sense, the music is sending us breakdancing in Cairo’s dusty flux of multi-period buildings and making us do the splits on a pyramid. It’s just incredibly riddled with richly characterful sounds that are shredded into mind-bending geometries, from convulsive knots of noise to calmer passages inhabited with Arabic voices and powerfully rhythm-driven bits spitting strange vocaloid artefacts.

Headphones recommended. \"One of the many functions of music is to listen to it. I grew up in a time when the vinyl album became the most important format, when pop music became prog rock, jazz rock, kraut rock, with many references to and from classical, contemporary and improvised music – music forms in which the long form is the rule rather than the exception. As a listener, I always found it exciting to immerse myself in a torrent of sound that would take me on a journey to new, unexplored areas. With headphones on or in front of two good speakers, at home or at a concert. As a musician, although I occasionally combine several short pieces into a longer composition, I have always found it difficult to build pieces over 7 minutes. It seems the extended format works better with projects that were not originally intended for release, such as live performances or installation / sound art, like the other two works I've done in the past, which in my opinion deserve the term \"deep listening\": Kippschwingungen, a piece that uses the legendary Subharchord synthesiser; and Isolation, which was originally composed in 2012 for a sound installation in a former solitary confinement cell.\" less"

   "name": "Marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Brian Eno’s classic ambient excursion with his brother Roger, and studio whizkind, Daniel Lanois, re-enters the vinyl orbit for the first time since 1983, bolstered with booster pack of previously unreleased material. Conceived as a soundtrack to Al Reinert’s 1983 documentary, ‘For All Mankind’, the wide-eyed wonder of ‘Apollo’ has taken on a life of its own as one of Eno's best loved and most influential ambient trips, especially for the divine choral of ‘An Ending (Ascent)’ which also made its way onto movie and doco soundtracks (28 Days Later, Traffic, Trainspotting) and was sampled by Burial in ‘Forgive’. Out of print for too long, the original LP is now remastered for this edition and extended with a new re-do of the soundtrack by Eno and his original co-pilots Frankly worth it for ‘An Ending (Ascent)’ alone, ‘Apollo’ is also flush with key ambient themes that would strongly influence its antecedents, and it’s not hard to hear how its dusty, sanguine country themes would influence The Orb or the likes of Calexico and a thousand other starry-eyed wanderers in the ‘90s. Eno would go on to state that he was influenced by country music as a child, received from an Armed Forces radio station in Woodbridge, was used to “give the impression of weightless space”, and while it’s maybe not the first thing it connotes for us, Eno’s use here has made floating country & western guitars a key part of the classic ambient music makeup. So to the bonus disc, a “reimagining” of the original Apollo soundtrack that sees the Eno’s and Lanois reprise that gently awe-struck feeling of watching Apollo 11 land on the moon. It starts off with the super slowed weightless smudge of ‘The End of a Thin Line’ along with the elegant deep space waltzer ‘At The Foot of a Ladder’, and future classic material in the tremulous beauty of ‘Under The Moon.’ less"

This piece is an exploration on pulsating sounds, field recordings and samples. It is inspired by the way pulsating forms can help measure time, distances and serve as beacons. Where there is chaos, a pulsar remains as the only stable source of information. \"I believe that through longform pieces, the sounds that make up a composition are able to develop a more intimate dialogue with the listener. They come with a mindset of letting the sounds evolve at their own pace, sometimes with unusual rhythms and tempos. Working on a longform piece can be bit challenging, but ultimately a very rewarding process. The time to explore and fully develop the qualities of melodies or monotonous sounds is within the process of creating a soundscape. I think that some sounds can become more interesting through deep listening. Our ears begin to re-interpret a long lasting sound, and multiple, hidden tonalities, either imagined or existent, begin to emerge, giving the piece a quality of never being quite the same on each hearing.\" less"

Together they effectively worked “in the darkness”, with players only given minimal or even no direction in the recording process, in order to convey the sensation of moving into the absolute unknown of a black hole. Together they arrive at an open-ended conclusion that’s simultaneously pensive and languorous, static and transitory, alternating the effect of making listeners feel like a speck of fluff in cold expanse of space, pregnant with dread, with shocks of visceral violence in the deathly metal rupture of ‘Rape of Boyse’ and the tremulous beauty of ‘Willow’, a plush downstroke of Tindersticks genius steeped in early Scott Walker vibes.

Features pedal steel guitar played by Joe Winslowand cello and bowed banjo by Aaron Martin “Umberto is an artist whose work is distinctly cinematic. Composer Matt Hill’s performances and delicate compositions taken together have the cumulative ability to surprise. Hill, whose Umberto moniker is an homage to director Umberto Lenzi, is an experienced and active film composer, most recently scoring the film All That We Destroy. In addition to film and commercial work, Umberto has released a number of lauded solo recordings. Hill’s compositions stand apart as beautiful as they are impenetrable, with pulsing synths that hint at 80s slasher films while pensive string passages evoke emotions without being sentimental. On Umberto’s Thrill Jockey debut Helpless Spectator, his haunting music is otherworldly and affecting alike, leaving the listener with an unsettling and profound air of mystery. Umberto’s early recordings harken back to classic synth-driven sci-fi and horror soundtracks. Helpless Spectator uses synthesizers in an entirely different manner. Cold, looming monolith tones are now warm, softer pads that envelope the listener while guitar, cello, banjo and pedal steel add movement and light. Still, Hill unsettles with his arrangements and melodic phrasing. As a composer, Hill has moved to more extensive use of live instrumentation. In addition to playing guitar, bass, and piano himself, Hill worked with fellow composer and recording artist Aaron Martin who played cello and bowed banjo on the majority of the album. “Idaho Joe” Winslow’s pedal steel guitar adds depth and subtle countermelodies to “The Higher Room” and “Leafless Tree.”” less"

   "name": "With incredible tactility and nuance Nicola Ratti (Bellows) evokes odd, bittersweet sensations and stimulates the proprioceptive senses in his definitive new solo opus for Students of Decay. As usual Ratti gets the most out of minimal input on ‘Continental’, but where his previous string of LPs up to and including 2017’s ‘The Collection’ were defined by their austerity, his music now feels more expansive, sensuous, and subtly illuminated. It was conceived of by Ratti as a “series of big rooms or places to get lost in, full of small details and characterized each by a single flavor or perfume” and we can vouch the fact that he’s beautifully achieved his aim within. The album’s eight tracks tease the listener’s sense of anticipation and orientation with an uncanny, calmly psychedelic potential perhaps equivalent to the effect of microdosing or jetlag. Entering the gates of ‘Palace’ he comes off like K. Leimer playing in the official residence of Rashad Becker’s Notional Species, and continues to work inside that imagined aesthetic between glassy geometries also recalling the quietest side of Sote in ’nº1’, while ’nº2’ suggests an electro-acoustic simulation of Japanese gaga or Korean classical court styles, and ’nº7’ comms off like Bellows at the beach. However the Lp’s trippiest highlight is reserved to ‘Cuarto’, where a quualude-loaded Dale Cornish drawls over non-Newtonian bass texture and tart harmonic fumes, before ’nº8’ melts and tootles like a semi-organic Pierre Bastien creation left to shrivel and curdle in the sun.

One of the strangest, most mermorable and quietly influential albums of the twenty tens. In 2011 the album appeared like a dream that was difficult to shake. Traversing a haunting mixture of avant-garde scenery into sublime passages of plaintive songcraft and steepled organ refrains in only the first track, it knocked us for six and still does, becoming one of those records we don’t listen to everyday, but one which resurfaces like a rare, perennial bloom. Now at the opposite end of the decade in which it was released, we can safely say it’s among the strongest records of this strange decade. Reentering its oneiric corridors feels like a flashback, especially in the exquisitely Lynchian dimensions of ‘The Falling Age’ where she channels Julee Cruise at her most ghostly, while the Laurie Anderson-esque pop of ‘Goddess Eyes’ still casts its spell with surreal effect, and the dream-pop fireworks of ‘Celebration’ has lost none of its capacity to freeze the spine with an ecstasy comparable to Alice Coltrane, and which, with hindsight, now recalls Teresa Winter’s intimate psychedelia. The additional pieces are subtle cherries on top, with the scene setting fog horns and vintage Hollywood-like SFX of the introduction, and her etheric interlude of drifting baroque organ beautifully helping to expand the LP’s theatrical framework, based on the Ancient Greek play ‘Hippolytus’ (aka the ‘Tragedy’ of the title).

Realised and rendered together with Jordan GCZ and Gigi Masin, among others, their debut LP '1' is an elegant exercise in breaking free of the grid, consolidating a spectrum of congruent ideas and idiosyncratic styles with a beautifully communal spirit putting a contemporary spin on the freedoms of '70s jazz fusion. From initial studio sessions recorded by Matthew and Max in their respective Baltimore and Washington DC studios, they incorporate synth and piano overdubs dialled in from Amsterdam and Venice, hashing out an inter-continental web of hyaline electronics, jazz ballistics and alien dance patterns that surprises and delights with every turn. Stepping into vividly new territory with the fractious post-footwork spurts of '3D', their kaleidoscopic world twists between the sheer computer jazz fusions of 'Intoo' and visionary 4.1 World house in 'Total Care Zero', glyding on the digitally creamed quintessence of 'Bell Slide' to the intra-dimensional ambience of Gigi Masin's keys and Papich's 3D FX in 'Silver', and adroit Afro-futurist jazz in 'Mint' starring 1432R co-founder Dawit Eklund on bass + synth. On a lysergic level of production detail, '1' is up there with Pete Kember's work on the recent Panda Bear album, but the dextrous grooves and intoxicating jazz vibes place it over the horizon, just beyond Move D's classic Conjoint project or Detroit's Urban Tribe classics.

This is a fine history lesson for many yungers, and a red-eyed flashback for many heads who came thru in the '90s. Originally released on cassette in edition of only 100 copies, it documents late night sessions recorded in New York during the formative era of abstract and experimental beats - a natural progression from more gangsta and hardcore styles to someplace more esoteric, smoked-out, and featuring contributions by non-rhyming MC Sensational, the earliest iterations of Kevin Martin (The Bug) as Techno Animal, and The Jungle Brothers. I n the parlance of the day; it's a trip, boy. Most of the tracks were produced or \"reduced & jinxed\" by Spectre, including a number of on-the-fly basslines and drum loops lending it a really frayed and lop-sided quality that producers have tried to recreate since, and definitely sounds leagues away from the last half decade or so of trap trills. But it's also weird for the inclusion of pitched-down, spoken word intros for each cut, framing it closer to a radio show than typical mixtape.

You know what to do “The lesser-spotted jazz atoms that formed the fusion of Futurist Flanders! It might sound like an ambitious claim but having been a firm fixture at the top of many European jazz collector want lists over the past decade Finders Keepers wouldn’t be alone when proclaiming this extremely rare, lesser-known two-track 7″ from 1969 as one of the best jazz 45s of all time! Alongside Polish pianist Krzysztof Komeda’s soundtrack 7″ for the film Cul-De-Sac and ranking closely with François Tusques’ commemorative Le Corbusier exhibition 45 (featuring Don Cherry) this format-specific release known only as Brussels Art Quintet might well sit at the top of the podium while striking similarities and arguably combining the best stylistic traits of both aforementioned contenders. This is all speculative and clearly a matter of individual opinion but it’s not often that one should find a recording from this era, comprising such high production qualities, keen compositional values and robust craftsmanship spread across two equally spellbinding individual tracks, all of which awards this record justified hyperbole albeit subject to a 50 year delay. It is safe to say that this unique release is “rare” on many levels. Like all privately pressed art projects this 45 comprises some serious outsider art trappings. However, on closer inspection it also stands as a pivotal record in the micro-genre of Belgian jazz, pin-pointing an early axis for some vital progressive jazz players who went on to become sturdy pillars of the central European happening. Essentially as a five-piece, the short-lived Brussels Art Quintet neatly combines members of both the mythical Babs Robert Quartet (early exponents of Belgian spiritual jazz) and key players from the leading progressive jazz/rock/funk unit known as COS (formally Classroom) who would stand as close affiliates of the likes of Marc Moulin, Kiosk and Placebo through the 1970s. Reproduced in close collaboration with COS leader Daniel Schell, who, under the early guise of Daniel “Max” Schellekens, authored both tracks that make up this facsimile 45 single, this one-off single includes the only known output by the Brussels Art Quintet thus marking the essential in-road to instantly start and complete your entire BAQ collection not without reliving the early germination of the froward-thinking jazz fusion that came to shape Belgium’s truly unique movement.” less"

The Finnish production/design duo’s most significant release locates their EDM/pop voice proper after a string of prism-pushing singles, EPs and mixtapes issued since 2015 by Young Turks and Gum Artefacts Bending EDM pop with warped sound designer sensibilities and a sci-fi visionary’s lust for post-human possibility, Amnesia Scanner’s music has come to define its era with unflinching form. They embrace the most compelling, even grotesque aspects of hyper-commercial dance-pop with an accelerationist alacrity that’s also shared by the boundary-realigning styles of fellow artists such as Arca and Sophie, who, like AS, started out in the sound designer’s playground of mid-’00s electro and tech-house minimalism, but have evolved into something mutant, transcending and redefining conceptions of humanity in their music. Informed by a singular perspective on technology and the way it mediates contemporary experience, ’Another Life’ is ostensibly binary in the extreme - you’ll probably either love or hate the upfront garishness and unapologetically cybernetic nature of their music. But on another level, the character of AS’ synthesised voice, known as Oracle, and their warped pop conventions, both inherently play with ultra contemporary ideas of ambiguity in a way that’s symptomatic of a socio-political climate dominated by notions of gender fluidity and fake news. In effect ‘Another Life’ can be heard as an attempt to locate the analog nature of human sensation within computerised systems. The results are effectively an exaggerated, syncretic synthesis of current Caribbean dance-pop, nu-metal, and trashy electro-punk with all elements turned up to 11 on their virtual amp, presenting a shockingly surface level reflection of contemporary culture that’s revealed a line in the sands of time between listeners of differing generations, and how they read meaning into their music.

An American artist born in Hollywood, CA, 1959, Joseph Hammer turned his fascinations with sci-fi and AM radio into psychedelic gold with the frayed loops and station strafing dynamics of ‘I Love You, Please Love Me Too.’ Following on from Pan’s wildly flung selections of pachinko parlour recordings by Ilios, early Schimpluch Gruppe works, and musique concrète by Sewer Election, Hammer’s offering kept the label’s remit blindingly wide open with a roiling flux of snagged voices, riffs and spectral electronic interference that perhaps most uncannily reflected the dense flux of pop cultural data and musical history that was being uploaded to the internet and ingested by algorithms in 2010. In its para-dimensional effect, the two long pieces of collage will surely remind anyone old enough of dicing around with an old analogue radio dial during formative years, picking up the usual pop detritus along with voices from overseas (and maybe even phone calls from down the road - this used to happen!). That innocent charm is key to the appeal of ‘I Love You, Please Love Me Too’, but there’s a also a crafty logic that underpins the whole thing, steering it away from, say, the daftness of People Like Us, and placing it in that special category of WTF?! classics by Robert Ashley, Carl Stone and The Automatics Group. less"

It’s guaranteed all-killer, nay filler, pet. At long fucking last Errorsmith relinquishes his long awaited new LP for the good of the dance, twysting Black Atlantic rhythm patterns with computer music in a way that pushes all of our buttons at once. The album’s key is cheekily embedded in the title, as the arch Berlin disco sound designer assuages Superlative Fatigue by properly drilling down to the truth of the matter - the purest, most effective grooves and scintillating sounds to flip wigs like nobody else. As with Erik Weigand aka Errorsmith’s strongest club productions such as the legendary Donna [1997] as part of MMM with Fiedel, thru to Protogravity [2015] with Mark Fell, the dancefloor is squarely in focus on Superlative Fatigue. However, this is Errorsmith solo, and as such it serves to bridge a fair gap between the innovative, oblique constructs of his Errorsmith #1 [2000] EP, and the unflinching documentary of his avant practice in Near Disco Dawn - Live Recordings 2001-2003 [2004], perfectly consolidating his avant-garde and populist tendencies with little concession to either side of the dichotomy. To be clear; Superlative Fatigue is a proper party record. Entirely written using Weigand’s self-developed Razor software (as wickedly deployed by Mark Fell on the Manitutshu album), it inventively gives voice to the impish computer spirits that have been dancing around his head all those years since his last solo output; placing a keen knowledge of current macro trends and myriad, classic subgenres to utterly compelling service, then ratcheting the effect thru singular manipulation of their accents, tropes and structures with a necessarily scientific approach perhaps only comparable to Rashad Becker’s on the Traditional Music For Notional Species volumes. No messing, the pinging dancehall of Internet of Screws is in our top 5 tracks of 2017, and the uncanny valley anthem of My Party is likewise among the year’s most ear-worming, while the likes of Centroid and the face-twysting sourness of I’m Interesting, Cheerful and Sociable place the freshest spin on UKF and electroid Afrobeats we could hope for, and the suspension-lowering Retired Low Level Server is possibly the baddest acid-hall riddim since Acid Rain Records’ year 2000 template.

We'll make no bones about it: the 'Scythians' EP is one of our favourite releases of 2014 so far, and comes strongly recommended to fans of Visionist, Evian Christ, E+E, TCF, Sudanim, Total Freedom… less"

   "name": "Restlessly shapeshifting composer Marc Richter turns out his 2nd album of the year already for Thrill Jockey with a further study in gurning dissonance following from the smeared brass and unearthly churn of ’Seven Horses For Seven Kings’ “Black To Comm masterfully manipulates sound, his alterations rendering sources unidentifiable and serving as a sort of portal to new realities. Composer Marc Richter collapses the past, present and future of recorded music into kaleidoscopic pieces that transcend genre, bristling with detail: an intense sensory sonic experience. Before After charts a hallucinogenic journey through polar extremes of emotion and to the outer reaches of sound, is a perfect companion to the darker Seven Horses For Seven Kings. Richter’s technical approach to making music is deeply rooted in his philosophy of time. He points to a quote from early electronic pioneer Eliane Radigue: \"everything is an interval, we are always in-between. And in this interval, between two states, there is a continual expression of invisible variations, imperceptible transitions.\" Before After exists in that fluid, liminal space, drawing on sounds and influences from disparate pasts and using these to synthesize new futures. “They Said Sleep” applies contemporary studio techniques to ancient material, creating a Chopped ‘n’ Screwed edit of an early medieval folk song. “The Seven Of Horses” expands on the language of Bulgarian Folk by adding abrasive new textures, processing piano sounds through analogue filters. Even Richter’s own material is ripe for reinvention, “Etas-Unis” and “Perfume Sample” both revisit elements of music from Seven Horses For Seven Kings with results that are entirely new and revelatory of the compositional and sound sculpting skills of Richter. Before After was written during the same sessions that gave birth to Richter’s recent, highly acclaimed, Seven Horses For Seven Kings. The intentionally crafted companion pieces mine similar raw sonic materials to yield radically different results. Where Seven Horses was a dark work focused on anger and desperation, Before After finds faint glimmers of hope in the same sources. By reappraising the past Richter divines new futures, opening up parallel timelines and sonic universes. The album bookends the current phase of Richter’s output as Black To Comm, a decisive statement piece that leaves the future of the project tantalisingly open-ended.” less"

   "name": "Scowling industrial bad vibes from Frederikke Hoffmeier’s Puce Mary, mounting her debut LP with PAN after dishing out dozens of albums and oddjobs for Posh Isolation, Ascetic House, iDEAL under her own name and also as Amphetamine Logic, JH1.FS3, and Body Sculptures during the preceding decade “Building from a reputation of arresting live performances and critically acclaimed releases Puce Mary breaks new ground with The Drought, evolving from the tropes of industrial and power electronics to forge a complex story of adapting to new realities. Remnants of noise still exist, sustaining the penetrative viscerality offered on previous records, however The Drought demonstrates an intention to expand on the vocabulary of confrontational music and into a grander narrative defined by technical and emotional growth. Bringing together introspective examination with literary frameworks by writers such as Charles Baudelaire and Jean Genet, Puce Mary’s compositions manifest an ongoing power struggle within the self towards preservation. The traumatised body serves as a dry landscape of which obscured memories and escape mechanisms fold reality into fiction, making sense of desire, loss and control. The Drought presents both danger and opportunity; through rebuilding a creative practice centred on first person narrative and a deliberate collage of field recordings and sound sources Puce Mary injects an acute urgency across the album seeking resilience. “To Possess Is To Be In Control” makes use of lyrical repetition as an ambiguity of two selves, or a divided self, attempting to consume one another, while “Red Desert,” named after Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1964 film, portrays the individual subsumed by surrounding environmental forces. The seven-minute epic “The Size of Our Desires” acts as the emotional tipping point of the record; amongst the ominous drone and dense feedback flutters almost-beatific melodies, while the lyrics reveal a romantic call to be swept up in the midst of an increasingly uninhabitable world. Rather than escape, The Drought dramatises a metamorphosis in which vulnerability is confronted through regeneration. Noise and aggression no longer act as an affront to react against but part of a ‘corporeal architecture’ where space, harmony and lyricism surface from the harsh tropes of industrial music. The Drought chronologises the artist’s transformation through a psychological famine, new ways of coping akin to plant survival in a desert – to live without drying out.” less"

   "name": "PAN's first ever CD release was also the first collaborative output by respected electroacoustic sound artists Thomas Ankersmit and Valerio Tricoli. Their five tracks on 'Forma II' were composed and recorded in Berlin from 2008 to 2010, and include four shorter electroacoustic pieces based on experiments with a Serge Modular Analogue synthesizer and one long-form tract of overdubbed saxophone exploring the timbral extremes of Ankersmit's instrument. The four hyper-sensitively detailed electroacoustic pieces range from 6 to 13 minutes in length and move between ultra-vivid blizzards of textural detail to plangent drone and vast atmospheric diffusions. Through deft computer and tape processing coupled with almost tangibly \"real\" sound sources such as metal foil floating on ultrasonic soundbeams or the man made resonance of the radar domes at Teufelsberg outside Berlin, the pair create a kinetic space which challenges our perception of simulated, or virtual shapes and spatial settings, and non-virtual, acoustic tangibility. In particular, the thirteen minute 'Plague #7' is an immersive passage of deep, thrumming bass tones and glassy hi-frequencies with the potently surreal effect, while the longer finale, 'Takht-e Tâvus' builds a swarm-like cluster of sumptuously discordant saxophone tones amassing a slow, gripping intensity and uncannily natural detailing. The CD is really brought to life by Rashad Becker's mastering at Clunk, and comes housed in one-tone silk screened pvc sleeve with interweaving geomteric designs, with artwork by Kathryn Politis and Bill Kouligas. Another exceptional transmission from PAN, a label that's fast attained buy-on-sight status. less"

   "name": "Pacific Breeze documents Japan’s blast into the stratosphere. By the 1960s, the nation had achieved a postwar miracle, soaring to become the world’s second largest economy. Thriving tech exports sent The Rising Sun over the moon. Its pocket cassette players, bleeping video games, and gleaming cars boomed worldwide, wooing pleasure points and pumping Japanese pockets full of yen. \"Japan’s financial buoyancy also permeated its popular culture, birthing an audio analog called City Pop. This new sound arose in the mid ’70s and ruled through the ’80s, channeling the country’s contemporary psyche. It was sophisticated music mirroring Japan’s punch-drunk prosperity. City Pop epitomized the era, providing a soundtrack for emerging urbanites. An optimistic spirit buzzed through the music in neon-bathed, gauzy tableaus coated with groove-heavy strokes. Pacific Breeze is an expertly compiled collection of choice cuts that range from silky smooth grooves to innovative techno pop bangers and everything in between. Long-revered by crate diggers and adventurous music heads, this music has never been released outside of Japan until now. Including key artists like Taeko Ohnuki and Minako Yoshida, as well as cult favorites Hitomi Tohyama and Hiroshi Sato, the long-awaited release also features newly commissioned cover painting by Tokyo-based artist Hiroshi Nagai, whose iconic images of resort living have graced the covers of many classic City Pop albums of the 1980s. Many of the key City Pop players evolved from the Japanese New Music scene of the early ’70s, as heard on Light In The Attic’s acclaimed Even a Tree Can Shed Tears: Japanese Folk & Rock 1969-1973, the first release of the ongoing Japan Archival Series. In fact, you could say City Pop set sail with a champagne smash from Happy End, the freakishly talented subversives who included amongst their ranks Haruomi Hosono and Shigeru Suzuki, both featured on this compilation. As Michael K. Bourdaghs noted in his book, Sayonara Amerika, Sayonara Nippon, this music was, “Deconstructing the line between imitation and authenticity.” Some of the best City Pop teeters in this zone—easy listening with mutant exotica, tilted techno-pop, and steamy boogie bubbling beneath the gloss.\" less"

   "name": "In the 15+ years that have elapsed since 'Loop Finding Jazz Records' first shuffled out of his ambrosially dusty speakers, Jan Jelinek's most famous album has acquired an almost mythical status. Originally released via Pole's defunct Scape imprint, it now finds new life via Jelinek's own Faitiche label, for a new generation to marvel at one of the finest examples of loop-based electronic music typical of the early noughties. Taking what reads like a pretty austere set of ingredients, Jelinek's technique revolves around a trio of elements which consist of second long cuts of 1960's-70's jazz recordings, the loop-finding modulation wheel (do your homework!) and the Moiré effect; albeit rendered in the acoustic as opposed to the image and spectral domains. If all this sounds a bit academic, be assured that on record it is anything but; as crumbling edifices of mealy rhythms slowly pulse into life and swirl around your head like snow storms clashing with a dust devil. Taking sediments of fathom deep static then skimming the best stuff from the top, Jelinek opens through the dampened echoes of 'Moiré (piano & organ)' wherein a slow-motion thrum of spiraling clicks, rustles and analogue tones conspire to give the impression of recondite perspectives that extend well beyond the constituent elements. Elsewhere, 'Rocky in the Video Age' instills a gratuitously optimistic blush to the aquatic micro-sound ebb, 'Moiré (Strings)' is a perfect companion to Basinski's disintegrating tape archive, whilst 'Them, Their' represents an aural crease so sleight you can only catch its distinctive gleam from the corner of your eye. less"

The birthplace of and inspiration for so much that we hold dear, Suicide's self-titled album is the very definition of future-proof, and its perfectly articulated vision of electronic punk minimalism seems more potent and prophetic today than it ever has before. Spacemen 3 and Spiritualized owe their entire careers to the soaring, deconstructed VU ascent of 'Cheree', the tough-guy technobilly dynamism of Sandra Electronics and Powell can be traced back to 'Ghost Rider', and the exquisite 'Che' is everything minimal wave promises but invariably falls short of delivering. Martin Rev's emaciated but propulsive drum-machine rhythms and fiendishly deployed shards of synthetic noise are of course impeccable, but listening back to this album we're reminded how much Alan Vega's utterly unique, utterly committed vocals make Suicide what it is: whether shrieking like a Times Square vagrant possessed on 'Frankie Teardrop' or coming over like a post-nuclear Elvis on the mighty 'Rocket USA'.

   "name": "The patron saint of maudlin romantics, Liz Harris (Grouper) adopts the Nivhek alias for this suite of freeform, glossolalic elegies, featuring a brief guest turn by Kiwi rock legend Michael Morley (The Dead C, Gate), and jointly dispensed between her Yellow Electric label and Superior Viaduct’s W.25th In two main movements comprising nine titled parts, Harris typically conjures a sense of stately calm underlined with menacing drones. However, the feeling is less bleeding heart and soporific, and perhaps better defined as floating and airily introspective. It’s a subtle but crucial distinction that resonates with her change of moniker and the widely reverberating dimensions and dynamics of the Nikhek sound. While the aforementioned guest Michel Morley is notable in his own right, and joined by Gabie Strong and Christopher Reid Martin on the two minutes of ‘Crying Jar’, the work is primarily by Harris, who alternates between steepled choral harmonies and long, plangent sections of gristly synth drone, spindly guitar and instrumental, melodic percussion (maybe marimba or gamelan?) that colours the air with a beaten gold quality. In many ways it sounds like Liz was left to her own devices in an abandoned church and she captured the results, as is, Áine O’Dwyer style, replete with external sounds of birdsong, possible distant road traffic and her visiting friends all detectable in the meridian. For anyone at this point overly familiar with Liz Harris’ style (hands up, obsessives), this album practically opens a new window to her world, letting fresh air and space diffuse her feels into a more elusive, ponderous way that’s as refreshing as it is uncannily familiar, especially when she drops the vocals for long periods, but one can still imagine their trace there, lingering in the air. less"

Far as we can tell, TRjj stems from TRIIMusik, “a loose group based in Germany since 1998” and revolving active members ALEPHER, Francis PON, Wanda Hotl, E.P.I., ZOVV, V-complex, Kutschi Mane, and the aforementioned Max Stocklosa, whose name crops up more often than the others. Despite so many hands on board, though, the music is remarkably coherent, sounding to our ears like the work of a smaller and tighter group. It’s surely testament to the collective’s minimalist modesty and shared vision that this is the case, and duly highlighted in the poetically-sequenced track selection by Ziggy Devriendt aka Nosedrip. Making sterling use of samples ranging from African and Americn folk to modern free improv, the album spreads out from ether-dream ambient in the introductory ‘Emulation of History (Disguised Drums)’ to crumpled trip hop recalling Hype Williams on ’Shadow Expert II’, constantly surprising at each turn with subtly mutating backdrops united by a recurring vocalist who we’ll presume for now is Max Stocklosa.

Served in the wake of a series of albums where Sarah tested her improv mettle on everything from pipe and reed organs to analog synths - garnering a cult following in the process - her first album of 2019 confirms a versatile and bountifully prolific artist at work. Recorded at the famed Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, the first side is a three part suite ‘Perfumes I-III’, with the title a perfect allegory for the way her music diffuses and intoxicates with the quality of warm skin radiating gentle energy. She spends the first part coaxing keys into solemn figures and willowing overtones, seemingly in duet with her parallel, ghostly self or perhaps the spirit of Bach, setting the scene for one of most quietly devastating vocal appearances in recent memory when her (?) rich countertenor appears from nowhere in part II, channelling a richness and dreamy strangeness that transcends early choral music, torchlit blues-jazz and the kind of apparitions conjured by Akira Rabelais. The final part III of pealing drones and ultra sparse keys feels like a cats cradle to rest your head and reflect on the exquisite beauty of what just happened. The B-side’s 21 minute piece ‘If It Pleased Me To Appear To You Wrapped In This Drapery’ provides a fine contrast and counterpoint to the sublime nature of the A-side. Here Sarah uses slowly descending and softly vibrating string pitches to conjure a more visceral, even dissonant sound that achieves something like the keening wow and flutter of a detuned analogue synth, gripping our attention like a master narrator regaling the saddest story of their life.

   "name": "'Signals Bulletin' is the new album from Jan Jelinek, made in collaboration with Japanese organist Asuna aka Naoyuki Arashi. It’s vintage Jelinek; immersive scapes fizzing with colour, anchored by determined organ drones, primed for achieving bliissful, contemplative equilibrium. Jelinek explains: \"Watching the Japanese sound artist Asuna playing the organ, some people might be surprised. Asuna is no virtuoso flying over the keyboard in a rage. Instead, with the calm gestures of an office worker, he cuts strips of adhesive tape to the correct length before sticking them onto the keys of his instrument. In this way, large clusters of keys are held down, creating a dense and sustained range of frequencies, while the sound artist continually prepares further sets of keys or removes tape again. I have rarely seen a more convincing performance concept, with such a power to fascinate. I first met Asuna when we both gave a concert at the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, his home city. He performed the organ drones as described above and I immediately knew I wanted to collaborate with him. Six years and five meetings later, we completed 'Signals Bulletin'. The album includes both joint improvisations and compositions, recorded in Berlin, Kanazawa and Kyoto. Whether using prepared organ, Casio keyboards or mechanical plastic toys, Asuna creates rich textures of sound that barely change over long stretches of time. It is a music without breaks. For a while, I was unsure how my loops made using modular synthesizers and live sampling fitted here – until I realized the role I had to take in this duet: I would provide the rhythmically pulsating foundation over which his dense continuums could unfold. The result is harmonically drifting superclusters that put us into a meditation-like state. It can perhaps be compared to Automatic Writing – a mode of creative expression floating somewhere between concentration and distraction. Both the structure of our pieces and our approach to our instruments allow a similar “absence”: we let the machines play and repeat themselves – while we, in a mild form of trance, adopt the role of observers, intervening only occasionally. It is no coincidence that Asuna owns a collection of Doodle Art – drawings jotted down during conversations or while talking on the phone. It is said that works made like this point to the unconscious and reveal pet motifs – because a doodler always inadvertently returns to his or her favourite themes. The artwork for Signals Bulletin features pictures from the collection, in this case sheets of paper from the pads provided in stationery shops to test out pens. The special quality of such doodles is that the jumble of drawings is the work of a collective whose individual members do not know each other. Layer by layer is added, by someone different each time – until it becomes a dense cluster of lines and symbols ...\" Jan Jelinek, Berlin 2018 less"

   "name": "This is f×cking amazing - a second volume of desolate, ambient themes from David Lynch’s sound designer and mixer of choice Dean Hurley, one of those behind-the-scenes guys whose work most subtly colours the popular imagination. If you’re into anything from Deathprod to Badalamenti to Mica Levi’s 'Under the Skin’, the more ascetic end of work from Leyland Kirby / The Caretaker, or Aphex Twin’s ’Selected Ambient Works Vol II” - this will rule your world. Having operated and managed David Lynch’s Asymmetrical sound Studio for 13 years, Dean Hurley only appeared on our radar a couple of years ago with his sound design for the third season of Twin Peaks, and the first volume of his Anthology Resource which collected some of that work. During those 13 years - a period that began just before ‘Inland Empire’ - Hurley was basically there to create, mix and edit any sound artefacts Lynch required - a process that evidently allowed him the freedom to innovate through pretty much limitless experimentation. As a result, Hurley is now without question one of the most striking sound designers and supervisors working in film & television right now, steering well clear of overly emotive/manipulative cliche and instead focusing on the minutiae of sound in a way thay recalls the classic, pre-digital era. His Anthology Resource is an ongoing series curated from his work for film and television in the library / production music tradition, as well as a series of albums in their own right, with this second volume 'Philosophy of Beyond’ collecting 12 pieces made in residency for Art Gallery of New South Wales’ event Masters of Modern Sound, and contributions to Eddie Alcazar's feature film ‘Perfect’ - mostly assembled from tape loops and field recordings. While it’s fair enough to wheel out a usual list of ambient/atmospheric comparisons with ‘SAW II’, Brian Eno, Leyland Kirby, and indeed David Lynch’s own early work with Badalamenti, that’s really just to show what class Hurley is operating in - his music clearly possessing its own, menacing magick that stays with you long after the music has stopped, just like the imagery he is so highly adept at scoring. less"

We understand that they have recruited young operative known as Dazion, a keen windsurfer, to develop a method of broadcasting their addictive and mind-altering musical missives wherever there is a suitable body of water. Our operatives tracked Dazion to a remote spot on the dutch coast, where he was spotted trialling this new technology with his favoured F2 dragon board. As he rode the choppy waves, we were able to detect and record rhythmical electronic music emanating from the board itself. we enclose this recording, which features the kind of tribalistic, delay-laden drums, swelling electronics and exotic melodic refrains that are known to inspire frenzied dancing in members of the public. we have christened this recording “dragon wave”. After exiting the water, Dazion packed up his top-secret windsurfing technology and drove to a backstreet address in a quiet area of Amsterdam. There, in a light industrial unit, he continued to tinker with the technology, testing it out by broadcasting another musical composition. this was more poignant and melancholic in tone, utilising spacey electronic melodies, gently bobbing chords, heart-aching guitar flourishes and a tough but broken rhythm track. the recording – code name “VX Ltd” – had a huge impact on us emotionally and even reduced one operative to tears. It is our belief that the Safe Trip organisation will only increase in strength with Dazion’s involvement. We recommend watching the waves and winds intently for further developments.” less"

But the ‘natural fit’ element between East Nigerian Igbo highlife and Congolese rumba and soukous made for a unique beat: highlife-soukous.

The songs areproduced impeccably by Woods’ Jarvis Taveniere and Jeremy Earle, buffed up like a hardwood floor ready to be well-trod upon for an evening of romance and dance. The songs of Purple Mountains are a potent brew, stitched together from lifetimes, knitting the drift of the years with the tightest lyric construction Berman’s ever attempted. Honesty is archly in the air but lines of incredible bleakness somehow give way to playful distraction and the hiding of surprises for close listeners. Even still, as the songwriter once wrote, “every single thought is like a punch in the face.” It won’t take long after slapping the record on the platter for you to hear that this is one of those albums. There are breakup records. There are apocalypse records. Then there’s ‘Purple Mountains’. Berman’s songwriter’s bone’s never been laid more bare - if redemption doesn’t come on the lyric sheet, the act of putting these songs into singing, dancing form allows them their finest end - to provide infotainment for others, embodying moments of life and truth via music that elevates with disarming warmth and a reassuring commonality, even as David himself stands outside the communal campfires.\" less"

   "name": "New Age conduit Ariel Kalma’s mid-late ‘70s GRM recordings are set to blow a lot of minds with this deep dive compiled by current GRM audio restoration engineer and Transversales proprietor, Jonathan Fitoussi. Properly unnerving, beautiful proto-Lynchian vibes on this one. Sourced from a recently excavated box of tapes recorded during late night recording sessions in the GRM’s Studio 116 - the same concrète laboratory used in Bernard Parmegiani and Luc Ferrari masterpieces - this LP delves into some of Kalma’s earliest recordings to provide an enchanting listen and reveal the groundwork that came long before his relatively recent collaborations with mutual, explorative souls Sarah Davachi and Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe. The set owes a great debt of gratitude to Kalma’s pal, Jacques Darnis, who was coincidentally the GRM’s recording engineer during the ‘70s. Jacques employed his mate as assistant recording engineer, and would give Kalma a heads-up if the likes of Parmegiani has cancelled their evening booking at the studio, giving him the opportunity to record afterhours in what was one of the greatest facilities in the world at the time. Armed with food, drink and his sax, Kalma would hop in his car, bez over to the studio, and evidently make sterling use of these night time sessions. Opening with sustained sax looped into etheric infinity on ‘Paris Flight’, the album supplies five distinct but interrelated lines of Kalma’s subconscious thought transmuted into sound. ‘Le soleil au couchant’ finds him layering vocals recorded in the crypt of the Senanque monastery into a shimmering raga-like hymnal, while the LP’s central highlight ‘Voyage au centre de la tête sees Kalma’s companion Paule Salomon whispering, heavy-lidded, over burbling drum machine pulse that turns into a psychedelic wormhole, and the B-side’s couplet of ‘Ballade sure le lac’ and ‘Japanese Dream’ find him gently spiral into the low ends of a Bosendorfer grand piano, then layer the keys with sax in most sublime, effortless style, again making thorough use of the studio’s high end microphones and tape machines. less"

A sonic journey that now continues on „Gnosis“ that owns the signature sounds of the Istanbul born / Berlin based electronic artist and pushes them further. The Greek word „Gnosis“ meaning „knowledge reached through intuition and individual experience“ has been used throughout history by various schools of esotericism and thought, to signify gaining insight on workings of the universe. Coherently the album follows the hermit-like, truth-seeking traveller on a path through various times and geographies, through different forms of human experience.

   "name": "L.I.E.S bossman Ron Morelli returns with his fourth solo album and a shift of emphasis away from greyscale industrial to more introspective landscapes investigating atavistic ambient themes - highly recommended if yr into Tod Dockstader, Laurie Spiegel, Chris Marker’s ‘La Jetée’ and Jeff Mills’ recent astral excursions. For the first time on record, Morelli more or less completely mutes his drum channels and allows his sounds to freely float in imagined air. In the process he crisply reveals a latent, introspective side to his music that’s been occluded by noise in his clutch of grubby sores issued by Hospital Productions since 2013 - back when he changed his address from Brooklyn, NYC to the heart of the Parisian electronic music scene. As such the 8 bony diffusions of ‘Man Walks The Earth’ mark distance travelled from the gobs of 2013’s ‘Spit’, documenting a change of mindset from grizzled and paranoid to a more soberly contemplative and drily poetic expression of self. Composed during 2015-2018, the 8 liminal zones of ‘Man Walks the Earth’ see Morelli switch out immediacy and brashness for a more considered longview of electronic music. In key with his previous work it’s a smart regression of sorts, but this time reaching back beyond industrial music to a primordial sound recalling Tod Dockstader dabbling at the GRM in ‘A Long Walk At Night’, or Laurie Spiegel glimpsing unseen worlds in ’Stone Tools’, while album opener ‘Fear Upon Seeing His Reflection In The Lake’ hearkens back to Delia Derbyshire and Daphne Oram’s etheric, Radiophonic abstractions, and the parting beauty ‘The Sun Beats Stronger As Each Day Passes’ recalls the enigmatic appeal of Chris Marker’s sci-fi soundtrack for ‘La Jetée’ as much as Jeff Mills’ recent astral excursions. Following Collapsing Market’s archival issue of Iranian classical music, iridescent electronics by Ssaliva, and the amorphous environments of Metta World Peace’s ‘Zanclean’, Morelli’s new album presents a compelling perspective on the binds between socio-economics and cultural aesthetics that’s reflected in the LP’s sleeve art, Morelli’s own photo taken from the 86th floor of One World Trade Center, New York, detached and reframed by Ethan Assouline, characterising the basic human will to rebuild, only to destroy again. less"

Over the course of three years the label has come to define a very dark corner of the dubstep related universe, finding fans in unexpected places, from Ricardo Villalobos and Cassy at the housier end of the spectrum and T++ showing love from the techno end. The first CD opens with the dystopian classic 'The Rope Tightens' by the maverick Shackleton, with a horrific echo chamber lockdown featuring vocals from longtime Skull Disco affiliate Tenfold Vengeance, and moves onto later collaborations between Appleblim and Peverelist on their lauded 'Circling'. Shackleton's smacky voodoo dancer 'Death Is Not Final' is included, alongside the undulating drum workout 'You Bring Me Down' as well as Appleblim's now classic 'Vansan' making it's first appearance on CD. The second set is about as fresh as it gets, starting with T++'s techno enhanced remix of 'Vansan' and further cementing the Berlin connection with Pole's spatialized dub-scape version of Shack's 'Shortwave'. Peverelist's remix of 'You Bring Me Down' is surely one of the finest dubstepXtechno tracks of the year and is also included alongside the stunning T++ revision of Shack's 'Death Is Not Final', surely one of the tracs of year full stop! The most surprising remix comes from badawi, with a previously unreleased rethink of 'The Rope Tightens'. Raz Mesinai sticks with the original's extended format, but rewires it with a technofied yet meditative version that sounds like 'Polaroid' or 'Cern' era Monolake mixed with sound design approaching Peter Rehberg's frosty scapes for the KTL project. The depth and scope on this one can only be fully appreciated at home on a good system with all the lights out, or equally in a dark warehouse setting, this is riddimic futurism at it's finest. A final mention must be given to the terrific artwork from the mind of Zeke Clough beamed directly from a tower somewhere in deepest darkest Salford, applying the final but essential touch to a stunning package. less"

   "name": "Kankyō Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental & New Age Music 1980-1990 is an unprecedented overview of the country’s vital minimal, ambient, avant-garde, and New Age music – what can collectively be described as kankyō ongaku, or environmental music. The collection features internationally acclaimed artists such as Haruomi Hosono, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Joe Hisaishi, as well as other pioneers like Hiroshi Yoshimura, Yoshio Ojima and Satoshi Ashikawa, who deserve a place alongside the indisputable giants of these genres. Holding dozens of rare gems from Japan, ‘Kankyō Ongaku’ feeds the ambient zeitgeist with a sublime survey of hard-to-find works by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono, Joe Hisaishi and many others, all compiled by Visible Cloaks’ Spencer Doran and released for the first time outside Japan - including two tracks on vinyl not found on the CD. Extending an unprecedented overview of Japan’s intersecting minimal, avant-garde, and New Age music realms, Spencer Doran expertly sequences work by titans of the Japanese scene along with beautiful pieces by artists little known beyond the country’s borders. While many of us may be acquainted with the likes of Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Joe Hisaishi via their major label releases and work on Anime and Hollywood film soundtracks, the rest have largely remained obscure partly due to the notorious difficulty of licensing Japanese music in the west. Now, thanks to the work of YouTube algorithms in generating great interest in this area, and thru the dedication of obsessives such as Spencer Doran, this compilation is a very welcome part of the groundswell in official reissues from this unique, dreamlike time and space in the history of electronic music. Scanning the years after digital synths began to flood the market, and the ideas of ambient music (Eno), and furniture music (Satie) had taken hold in Tokyo, the music on ‘Kankyō Ongaku’ is design-driven to inhabit personal spaces, to meld into the background and subtly frame everyday life. Oozing connotations of sophistication and luxury, the music can be heard as a result of Japan’s bubble economy in the 1980s, when it become a common currency for corporations as much as record labels, ending up on vinyl and CD as well as public installations, adverts for Sanyo air-con unit, and in-store soundtracks for the likes of Muji - all of which are contained within this collection. It’s all so lovely that’s it’s a real struggle to pick highlights from the rest, and it would also miss the point - all the music shares the same ideal and executes its function exactingly, to linger in the air. It’s pretty much flawless stuff, awaiting the embrace of romantic sophisticates and Japan-o-philes everywhere. less"

   "name": "Out of print for 30 years, Airto Moreira’s Brazilian jazz-fusion masterpiece is now reissued for the first time. Moreira was key member of Miles Davis’ ‘electric’ group, notably playing on ‘Bitches Brew’ “The impact of Airto Moreira in both the world of American jazz and in Brazilian music is unparalleled. At the start of the 1970s Airto was invited to join Miles Davis’ groundbreaking ‘electric’ group, which with albums such as the seminal ‘Bitches Brew’ helping Davis regain his title from John Coltrane as the most important jazz artist of all time. Two years later Airto helped establish two of the most important jazz fusion groups of all time: Weather Report, with Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and Miroslav Vituous; and Return to Forever, with Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Flora Purim. Airto Moreira also began his solo career in the USA in 1970, and alongside his wife, the singer Flora Purim, and Brazilian artists such as Hermeto Pascoal, Sivuca, Deodato, Raul de Souza, Azymuth, all played a major part in the Latinised sound of American jazz fusion throughout the 1970s. By this time Airto established himself in the USA in the 1970s, he had already had a formidable career back in Brazil in the 1960s as an important figure in the Bossa Nova movement, which soon after spread throughout the world. Airto played in a number of important groups during this time – Quarteto Novo Sambalanco Trio and Sambrassa Trio (all of with Hermeto Pascoal) – which proved to be three of the most ground-breaking groups of this era. The album ‘Samba de Flora’, including the seminal jazz dance title track, is a masterpiece of jazz and Brazilian fusion and features Airto Moreira alongside Flora Purim, fellow Brazilian artist Raul de Souza and heavyweight USA jazz musicians Alphonso Johnson, percussionist Don Alias (from Stone Alliance), Cuban conga player Cachete and Argentinian pianist Jorge Dalto. The album was originally released on the small independent Montuno Record label (which was run out of the unassuming Record Mart record store situated in the Times Square underground subway station!) and has been unavailable for many, many years.” less"

   "name": "Expanded reissue of one of the most fascinating Japanese ambient/environmental albums ever made, NOVA + 4 by Yutaka Hirose. The package includes the album known as Soundscape 2: Nova, sourced from its original masters, as well as 50 minutes of never-released-before recordings, yielding dreamiest synth tones swaddled in richly detailed environmental recordings that conjure a beautifully soporific non-place for drifting minds. “Initially released in 1986 as part of the Soundscape series* commissioned by Misawa Home Corporation for use in their prefabricated houses, Yutaka Hirose’s NOVA has grown to become a mythical piece of the Japanese minimalist/ambient/environmental scene of the eighties. Initiated around the enchanting landscapes of the two first tracks recorded for the project, \"Nova\" and \"Epilogue\", Yutaka Hirose’s magnum opus serenely blends vintage synth with nature sounds, exploring soothing palettes and organic backdrops. For \"Slow Sky\", Hirose explains he \"went for a pointillism-like sound, and tried to express a scenery of awakening, where the portal of a heart is opening up\", while on \"Humming The Sea\", he \"tried to compose a kind of music that expresses the daily, lazy life of child-like innocence in a summer vacation in some small town.\" The bonus LP gathers four long unreleased pieces created around the same period of time for installations, described by Yutaka Hirose as \"not music per se but rather sound sculptures\", and including the haunting \"Shadow Of A Water Droplet\" which was recorded for an Ikebana exhibition. All in all, NOVA + 4 is a transcendent experience of nature in the urban context, an oeuvre which, much like Midori Takada’s Through The Looking Glass or Satoshi Ashikawa’s Still Way, holds the power to appease the soul in turbulent times. As one inspired YouTube commenter once said when describing Yutaka Hirose’s masterstroke: \"I can't tell if the birds are singing inside or outside! Thank you! \" less"

This is the body of the artist as aural ghost, her figure lit by shuddering rhythms and synthesized echoes, and she knows what she is doing when she stands in front of that light. Not only did she build it but she has written all about it, gathered the notes and transcribed the lyrics onto paper that is as sunshine. Guthrie is dazed and dazzling with so much light, yet the clouds roll in toward the light every time. Her translucent voice lifts your hem and so tender is her bite, so weird, so intense.

Enacting a musical ideal of being simultaneously within yet outside of the music, ‘Export’ sees RAP’s Guy Gormley (Enchante, Never) and Thomas Bush hover above musical timelines like puppeteers pulling the strings with an elegantly detached sense of control. In a smart way it’s a sound symptomatic of its times, economically efficient with its rhythms and melodies, and in the way they parse the most effective parts from techno, pop, and dub of the past generation while still sounding like the music was made circa 2019. On side A the tracks flow in unbroken sequence at the same tempo from the dub technoid ‘Baptism’ thru pastoral AFXian techno in ‘Ruin’ to the enlightened steppers meditation of ‘Young Persuasion’ making sparing but crucial use of Gormley’s plaintive vocal. The other side is then beautifully counterbalanced with the timeless, loner piano meditation ’Twisted Fix, before avian cacophony gives way to a sort of pulsing techno chamber music in ‘Mad Friday’, and a perfect transition into their deft pounder ‘No Mixer’ and an anthem in waiting with the marriage of fey, ear-worming vox and filtered thizz in ’NSEW Ravers.’ less"

This was one year after Wire disbanded for the first time, and Gilbert and Lewis had spent the interim constructing the Dome studio at the legendary Blackwing facilities. They had met Russell Mills during the Wire days and invited him into their Kupol performances, leading to his participation on ‘MZUI’, where the trio made use of a 5000 sq. feet former meat-packing warehouse space, turning its detritus into artworks including a meadow of smashed glass, and also installed a PA and recording equipment to capture and use any public interaction. It was all in near pitch darkness and so risky that visitors had to sign a disclaimer before entry. The music contained on ‘MZUI’ the release is not intended as a direct representation of the installation, rather it’s presented “as a landscape, as articulating a sense of place” according to Kevin S. Eden’s liner notes. In that respect, the album’s two 20 minute+ pieces offer a spectral tour of the warehouse, its contents and the installation’s attendees, with spare, aleatoric clangs, muffled voices, distant percussion and industrial eruptions occurring in acres of billowing negative space. It’s not hard to hear the vast dimensions of the space in the recordings in the first piece, which is compelling enough, but it really gets interesting in the 2nd part where they hold to longer, coherent section of curdled carnival music and noise, or particularly the mid-section of sepulchral choral drones and its transition into a looped quote of Marcel Duchamp intoning “in spite of myself, I’m a meticulous man.” More than a curio, this is a fascinating example of the Dome guys at their loosest and most intuitively experimental. less"

After Paul St. Hilaire (formerly known as Tikiman) had lent his voice to quite a few Rhythm & Sound releases over the years, the starting point for this project was to work with him once again and also with his brother Ras Perez, their fellow Berlin based Dominicans Koki and Ras Donovan (also known from his collaboration with Mapstation), the Berlin based Jamaicans Freddy Mellow, Walda Gabriel, Bobbo Shanti, Lance Clarke as Rod Of Iron and Joseph Cotton aka Jah Walton. With a toasting style heavily influenced by the legendary U-Roy, Cotton was a central figure in the jamaican DJ scene of the 70s and 80s. To cap it all off, on a visit to Berlin, the great Sugar Minott and Willi Williams (famous for Studio 1 classic Armagideon Time) did their versions in the Rhythm & Sound studio! For each tune the rhythm is arranged and mixed differently.

   "name": "After a blazing succession of Sound System heaters, Dug Out offers a spiritual session of seminal nyabinghi grounation from Dadawah circa 1974, perhaps the most mind-expanding, important spiritual dub reissue we've heard this last decade. It's most likely a large influence upon the work of label head Mark Ernestus in his Rhythm & Sound guise, recalling the magical spirituality of classics like 'Making History' among others in the hypntoic, shuffling pace and intangibly smoky aura that seems to evaporate from the grooves with each listen. The group is led by Ras Michael, guiding a traditional set up of nyabinghi (ceremonial Rasta drums), bass, guitar, brass and Piano organ in four extended excursions over sublime, psychedelic terrain without a worry in the world. As with much of the best reggae, much of the magic was elicited and embellished in post production, with Lloyd Charmers and Federal engineer George Raymond apparently staying up all night after the session to mix the recording, imbuing the tracks with a dazed, wide-open and echoing personal space. Keeping the standards impeccably high, the album was lovingly restored at Abbey Road and looks every bit the classic that it is.

The first disc revolves his banging Reduce 1 and the monotone brilliance of Reduce 2, whilst the 2nd disc renders the more tender gasps and dub chords of Solanus (Original) and the heady Elevation II - both masterclasses in German techno minimalism - while the 3rd disc significantly presents the flared chords of Antistatic, taken from the Elevations CD, on vinyl for the 1st time, backed with the exclusive-to-this-12” Antistatic II.

Its 10 tracks cogitate on the mind-numbing drudgery of life in less-than-exciting places where even bus routes avoid, using a rawly masticated mix of analog electronics to convey a chronic day-to-day smudge of the senses that conversely works as relief from the same thing, drawing a sort of double negative ecstasy from agrarian tedium. They get top marks for (nearly) naming four tracks after Scottish demigod Kenny Da(l)glish, including the primal thrum of ‘Kenny’s RockNRoll’, but our favourites are the loner mantra of ‘Rocks That Look Like Meat’ and the pebbledashed sputter of ‘Bilko’ where he really nails the feeling of slowly combusting frustration/noisy gratification. less"

This record is a one strong reason why Kate is among the most intriguing artists working with field recordings right now - make sure to check it. “I was one of the only people to hop off the train from Paris at the tiny Nogent-sur-Seine station. Looking around for someone who looked like they might be meeting me, I spotted a very unexpected sight – a large nuclear power complex not far off in the distance. I had arrived in this part of France, about two hours by the fast train to the west of Paris, to undertake recordings of the Seine, in a tiny town called Marnay. Unknown to me the river, which at this time is icy cold, had just started to recede after bursting its banks. Marnay is a town of just over 200 people. It is small, and its population appears to have dwindled dramatically. During the month I was there I often found myself cycling along empty streets, and the town's pub and hotel were shuttered and abandoned. There were no shops, and even the church was shut up and unused, although its electrified bell still tolled the hours. Elections took place that month, and the National Front took over the mayoralty from the sitting French Socialist Party candidate who told me on the night she lost about her memories of taking to the streets in May of '68. I have loved the Seine since I was a child and read a book about an artist trying to paint the river, and when I arrived it was certainly doing justice to my memories of that book, swollen and mighty, perilously cold and formidable. In some places it was so flooded it was impassable. The river, and its series of tributaries and canals, some of which appeared to have been created to serve the nearby nuclear complex, had established vast marshes of bog, particularly in the area which approached the rear of the reactors, and water birds had arrived in their hundreds to enjoy this vast increase in habitat. It was in these areas that I focused my recording.” less"

Also taking cues from the psychoacoustic research of Rytis Ambrazevičius, whose computer analyses highlighted the unique acoustic and harmonic complexities in these archival songs, Sabin subtly exaggerates and reroutes what he calls their “arresting and often almost plaintive and minimalistic beauty” into a suite of forested soundscapes that unfurl with a natural beauty comparable to Ian William Craig’s decayed, long exposure landscapes, the arcane and ritualistic atmospheres of Lussuria, or the wind-etched grain of Richard Skelton. less"

   "name": "Cellular Automata is the first new Dopplereffekt album in a decade! Rudolf Klorzeiger and To-Nhan kept us waiting but the anticipation pays off with some of their most striking electro architecture to date, tangibly making good on the promise of their Tetrahymena [2013] and Delta Wave [2014] deliveries over the interim, which, like this one were also released by Berlin’s Leisure System. The symbiotic duo’s last album, Calabi Yau Space [2007] remains one of the most memorable, puristic electronic records of its decade and Cellular Automata is up there with the most distinctive of its ilk in the current sphere. To outline their intentions; “Cellular Automata approaches mathematical growth and decay as an iterative process, with each data input considered individually relative to the overall model”, which broadly translates as a lofty metaphor for refinement thru increasingly searching practice; both technical research and the fine-tuned discipline of their physical, melodic inputs. Difficult to say really how that works out from initial listens, but in aesthetic terms at least their sound is shockingly sharp and dense yet incredibly spacious, executing that unique balance of sheer technological advance and heightened emotive response in way that’s long been key to the success of their sound, encouraging listeners to revel and marvel at both the pure sonification of their sounds and equally their near-baroque classical elegance. If you need any prompts, check out the vast harmonic structures of Cellular Automata and the tempestuous kosmische momentum of Exponential Decay at the album’s bookends, or deeper in for the uncanny stere-imaging of Gestalt Intelligence and the nerve-biting noise of Pascal’s Reunion, or the abyssal morphosis of Mandelbrot Set for the strongest sensations, but, as you’ll understand it’s definitely best consumed as whole for the most lucid yet disorienting experience. less"

   "name": "While the filtered, tape-fuelled obfuscation of Grouper's signature sound remains, Dragging A Dead Deer Up A Hill is far more resonant up front about the songs at the heart of her work. Opening track 'Disengaged' offers a segue from the cloudy, amorphous Grouper output of old and this current strain of more easily deciphered writing: it's a mass of mesmerising magnetic hiss and soft noise, with a voice cloaked in lo-fi haze somewhere at the back. Soon after, Harris' guitar and voice emerge, reverberant and phantom-like, and yet comprehensible. If previously you've struggled to make out Grouper lyrics, and wondered what's going on beneath that veneer of musty, degraded audio, 'Heavy Water/I'd Rather Be Sleeping' offers you a way in. Those dense recording techniques have become a unique production signature and it's virtually impossible to separate Liz Harris' creative identity from that uniquely ghostly sound of hers, but now it feels like a conduit to her songs rather than a barrier. There are echoes of her earliest work on the album too, as on the wordless, partially acappella atmospherics of 'Wind & Snow', but the overall impression left by this album is one of inspired creative renewal, and the unveiling of a songwriting talent that's previously been content to dwell in shadows and deflect attention with smoke and mirrors. A real milestone release for Harris, and a definite high point for the rejuvenated Type label, we've been unable to stop listening to this incredible album for weeks - it's an absolute must. less"

   "name": "Following a series of impossible-to-obtain releases for her own Yellowelectric imprint and a CD compilation of her gorgeous 'A I A' set, Liz Harris seems to have settled with Kranky who are re-releasing her classic Type album 'Dragging a Dead Deer..' and this new album of previously unreleased material drawn from the same period: 'The Man Who Died In His Boat'. It's not so hard to believe but we'll say this straight away - the material on this new set is just jaw-dropping, a worthy companion piece to 'Dragging a Dead Deer' - once again finding Harris delivering material edging ever so slightly towards more traditional 'songs' but executed with so much introspection and mystery that she really sounds unlike anyone, or anything, you'll have ever heard before. The record has an interesting backstory, as Harris explains - \"When I was a teenager the wreckage of a sailboat washed up on the shore of Agate Beach. The remains of the vessel weren't removed for several days. I walked down with my father to peer inside the boat cabin. Maps, coffee cups and clothing were strewn around inside. \"I remember looking only briefly, wilted by the feeling that I was violating some remnant of this man's presence by witnessing the evidence of its failure. Later I read a story about him in the paper. It was impossible to know what had happened. The boat had never crashed or capsized. He had simply slipped off somehow, and the boat, like a riderless horse, eventually came back home.\" The narrative somehow enhances the songs - an achingly beautiful combination of forlorn, reverb-drenched lullabies draped in a veil of isolation reminding us of a more damaged Mark Kozelek, and indeed the classic 4AD sound with which Grouper has been compared so many times in the past. By the time you reach the closing track 'Living Room', however, you come to the realisation that despite her best efforts to obscure her songs, Harris might just be one of the most gifted songwriters of her generation. An incredible album - possibly her finest yet. less"

   "name": "The first Grouper album in 4 years finds Liz Harris stripped of FX, pairing her vocals with skeletal piano gestures in beautifully pregnant space. For anyone familiar with the miasmic fuzz of Grouper’s previous releases, the relative clarity is quietly shocking in effect, revealing her songs and sound at their most vulnerable, and, in the process, locating a newfound strength in fragility. Grid Of Points was recorded in Wyoming shortly after Liz finished recording Grouper’s Ruins out in Aljezur, Portugal, and on the most immediate level it seems to describe the difference in recording locations between windswept Atlantic coastline and sparse, landlocked insularity. The seven songs were written over a week and a half, with the process curtailed by a bout of what she describes as “high fever”. What remains forms some of Grouper’s most legible lyrics and intimate instrumentation, with each piece framed by stark, unprocessed space working in the same role usually occupied by her billowing sheets of harmonic distortion. Untreated and unfiltered, Grouper's voice rings plaintively clear, sometimes layered in ephemeral harmonies or curling off with jazz-soul wise inflections shadowed by modest piano phrasing in a crepuscular style that links back to all her previous work. Yet, in places the clarity is such that it almost feels like we the listeners have just been hearing her songs with clogged ears for the past decade and longer. Ultimately, these results perhaps most acutely resonate with the etymology of Liz’s moniker - ‘Grouper’ as in member of a Fourth Way commune, The Group, which was inspired by the philosophy of George Gurdjieff, whose mystic meditations surely linger in the magick of Grid Of Points. less"

   "name": "Over the last decade, we’ve come accustomed to Jason Letkiewicz releasing material under a dizzying array of aliases, each utilized to explore a different side of his multi-faceted musical persona. Now, some 14 years after he made his recording debut alongside Ari Goldman as Manhunter, Letkiewicz has joined forces with Into The Light Records to release his first album under his real name. \"The Reflecting Pool sees Letkiewicz exploring the uncomplicated and uncluttered in the pursuit of pure aural beauty. While his recent album as Opposing Currents was dense, dark, urban and industrial, The Reflecting Pool is stripped back, quiet and melodious. The contrast between the two projects is marked, with The Reflecting Pool drawing more on Letkiewicz’s love of crystalline ambient, slow burn synthesizer soundscapes, early ’80s library music and the kind of obscure electronic new age music that has been a hallmark of Into The Light’s releases to date. The set’s 12 tracks gently ebb and flow, with Letkiewicz making great use of dusty old drum machines, effects units and a range of vintage analogue and digital synthesizers. It’s a set-up that results in a range of complimentary mood pieces and interludes, from the delay-laden military drums and lilting lead lines of “Out of Body Experiences”, to the drowsy, sunrise bliss of “Sunspot”, the bubbling Tangerine Dream style shuffle of “Mind Awake Body Asleep” and the outer-space atmosphere of “The Kill Fee”. Throughout, Letkiewicz showcases his seemingly intrinsic grasp of mood, atmosphere and melody. It can be heard within the glacial guitar motifs, occasional beats and elongated chords of “The Reflecting Pool”, the rhythmic bustle of “Numb Drums”, the glassy-eyed melancholia of “Arhythmia” and the cinematic paranoia of “Burning Off The Morning Fog”. It’s also evident amongst the classically beat-less ambient of closing cut “Weightless”, whose alien electronics, effects-laden pulses and opaque chords recall established masters of the genre. With The Reflecting Pool, Letkiewicz has provided us with a much-needed dose of stress-free musical escapism, at the same time offering hope that in these troubling times, love may still save the day.\" less"

Unavailable since the early ‘80s, and expensive to buy 2nd hand nowadays “Amazing private gospel modern soul/boogie LP originally released in 1981, featuring an alternate version of the dance floor killer \"Spread Love\". Having grown up in rural West Virginia, Michael Orr is a marvelously talented musician and accomplished singer, songwriter, and producer. From the time he was placed on a piano bench as a toddler, Michael has been playing and composing music. In 1975 Michael Orr recorded his first full record “Spread Love” which became an international classic. In 1979 he recorded his second and much lesser known album “Love Will Rise” in Los Angeles and released it on the Birthright record label. The single “Love Will Rise” was a tribute to The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A gem of a smooth soul album – completely rare in the original, and a fully honest testament from Michael Orr. Orr's got a real talent for a song – and his commitment to strong vocals can be heard in his mix of styles that recall bits of Andy Bey, Jon Lucien, Gil Scott-Heron, and DJ Rogers.

A 7 track collection of cosmic excursions and dubby ambient-jams, the album is written, recorded, played, produced and mixed by Carmen in her Oslo studio. The soothing atmospherics are made up of tapestries of field recordings, synths, piano, drum-programming, zither and modular sounds. Throughout, Carmen’s music is colored by experimenting with different sounds and learning new techniques or by adding new instruments to the mix. \"I’ve been playing around with instrumentals for a long time, and it was something I wanted to do more with after I finished Infinite Avenue,” says Carmen. “Leaving out my voice and lyrics got me out of my own head a bit, which I needed. Working with sound is to me the ultimate meditation and is a more unconscious way of expressing whatever is going on inside.” The flute, played by Chilenean-Norwegian Johanna Scheie Orellana (formerly of Sassy 009), is a central part of this new album. Carmen got her in to the studio to both record melodies that she had written, as well as making plenty of room for impro/freeform. Prins Thomas also appears on the record, playing percussion on “I Could Sit Here All Day.” “I made this track based on a Roland SH-101 sequence run through various processing,” says Villain. “The whole thing came together kind of like a jam, I wrote the flute in one take, and it just felt right. I wanted real flute on this, so asked Johanna if she'd like to come in, and we've been collaborating ever since.”” less"

   "name": "One of the most influential, insular and multi-layered albums of the last three decades, created through endless hours of improvisation - involving almost fifty musicians and recorded in complete darkness, 'Laughing Stock' is an album that has attained almost mythical status since its release in 1991. Following the commercial success of their singles \"It's My Life\", \"Life's What You Make It” and album \"The Colour of Spring”, Talk Talk retreated back into the shadows and produced two albums that defied categorisation. After the release of the first of these (Spirit of Eden) and a proolonged court case, the band parted ways with EMI and signed to iconic jazz imprint Verve who financed the long and complicated recording of Laughing Stock. Assembling almost 50 guest musicians, Mark Hollis is said to have demanded they record in almost complete darkness, improvising for hours to produce individual parts without hearing any backing tracks or surrounding material. Most of these recordings were discarded, but from what remained Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene pieced together a record that is essentially one long sequence of overdubs separated out into six long tracks. Laughing Stock was to be their last album - on its release the NME described it as “horrible” and many listeners were left perplexed by its insular, unfathomable dynamics. But in the time since, Laughing Stock's legacy seems to have grown in stature with every year that has gone by. You can easily see the stylistic and conceptual markers left by Talk Talk in the way that bands like Radiohead went on to explore more open-ended, diverse sound sources and stylistic shifts - feeling able to experiment without fear of alienating a large fanbase as if it were the most normal thing in the world for a band with considerable chart success to do. \"Laughing Stock\" is not only one of the most absorbing albums of the modern era, it’s also a masterclass of production and construction, a relic, perhaps, of an era when artists could completely disconnect from the pressures of their surroundings and dive deep into the wormhole... less"

It’s another deep blue mood piece full of fragmented Jazz loops which will be essential listening for those of you enamoured not only with 'Loop Finding Jazz Records’ but also his quiet masterpiece 'Personal Rock’, released under ther Gramm alias. If you’re as obsessed with that album as we are, this reissue is a must. \"For the original 2002 CD on Soup-Disk and Sub Rosa (Audiosphere), Jan Jelinek and the Japanese trio Computer Soup (Satoru Hori – trumpet, Osamu Okubo - toys & electronics, Kei Ikeda - toys & electronics) presented eight tracks all recorded one afternoon in the trio’s living room in Tokyo. They are excerpts from a joint group improvisation that subsequently underwent rudimentary editing, on which Jelinek and Computer Soup worked separately. Jelinek met the three musicians at his first concert in Japan in 2001, at Tokyo’s Yellow club, where Computer Soup performed as the support act. Delighted by their free improvisation on pocket-sized electronic toys, trumpet and oscillators, he arranged to meet Hori, Okubo and Ikeda a few days later for a session at their apartment. The resulting three-hour recording, made on their living room floor, formed the basis for Improvisations and Edits. A few days later, Jelinek returned to Berlin. Over the following months, they separately chose passages from the recording that were then edited and assembled into an album. Formed in Tokyo in 1996 as a quintet (including Shusaku Hariya and Daisuke Oishi), Computer Soup began by performing with acoustic instruments on the streets of Shibuya. Ikeda und Okubo soon switched instruments, and from then on the group’s minimalistic but densely woven sound was defined by electronic toys, oscillators and Satoru Hori’s trumpet. Their first album was released in 1997 on the Japanese label Soup Disk. Eight further releases followed.\" less"

   "name": "Slow, methodical organ recordings on this major new work from Kali Malone; a quietly subversive double album featuring almost two hours of concentrated, creeping organ pieces governed by a strict acoustic and compositional code with ultimately profound emotional resonance. Featuring additional organ pieces performed by Ellen Arkbro and mastering by Rashad Becker, you’re gonna wanna spent time with this one. ‘The Sacrificial Code’ takes a more surgical approach to the methods first explored on last year’s ‘Organ Dirges 2016 - 2017’. Over the course of three parts performed on three different organs, Malone’s minimalist process captures a jarring precision of closeness, both on the level of the materiality of the sounds and on the level of composition.The recordings here involved careful close miking of the pipe organ in such a way as to eliminate environmental identifiers as far as possible - essentially removing the large hall reverb so inextricably linked to the instrument. The pieces were then further compositionally stripped of gestural adornments and spontaneous expressive impulse - an approach that flows against the grain of the prevailing musical hegemony, where sound is so often manipulated, and composition often steeped in self indulgence. It echoes Steve Reich’s sentiment “..by voluntarily giving up the freedom to do whatever momentarily comes to mind, we are, as a result, free of all that momentarily comes to mind.” With its slow, purified and seemingly austere qualities ‘The Sacrificial Code’ guides us through an almost trance-inducing process where we become vulnerable receptors for every slight movement, where every miniature shift in sound becomes magnified through stillness. As such, it’s a uniquely satisfying exercise in transcendence through self restraint - a stunning realisation of ideas borne out of academic and conceptual rigour which gradually reveals startling personal dimensions. It has a perception-altering quality that encourages self exploration free of signposts and without a preordained endpoint - the antithesis to the language of colourless musical platitudes we've become so accustomed to. less"

While regarded among the avant-garde’s most active and prodiguous collaborators, playing on hundreds of recordings with everyone from UK jazz legends Evan Parker and Derek Bailey to the likes of Thomas Köner and David Sylvan, solo records from Prévost are notoriously thin on the ground, meaning he doesn’t fuck about when it’s time to strike on his own. ‘When Is Sound’ sees the percussionist and metamusician intuitively draw upon, and negotiate, over 50 years of action at the avant vanguard. Since his earliest work on AMM’s groundbreaking ‘Ammmusic’ Prévost has persistently pushed against rhythmic and sonic convention, probing it’s whys and whats from every angle, before now forming his open-ended conclusions about “when is sound”? Documenting a day of recordings made in Matching Tye, Essex, a village near his home stomping grounds, and also burial site of John Locke aka “the father of Liberalism”, Prévost takes cues from Locke’s ideas about “mixing labour with materials as a fore-running notion of possessive individualism and basis for private property” as a prompt to explore music as product of an open-source dialogue between history and the environment; between muscle/memory and the world around him. Variously recording between a village green and mostly in a centuries old church, the results are the kind of music that would baffle an AI but potentially and instinctively resonate with human senses. In ‘Mixing & Match’ he bows a cymbal with the tactile glee of a kid left alone in the music room, feeling out the instruments stress points and the way it interacts with surrounding architecture, while ‘Rotology’ sees him play rototoms in a way that describes bird flight with an atavistic rawness. ‘maxPlus’ follows with a nod to Max Roach that tramples archaic distinctions or declensions between Afro-American jazz and European Avant-Garde, and ‘Locke’d In’ sees him cannily transpose militant snare rolls with a coolly disciplined but frenzied free jazz flair, and ‘Air, Oak, Metal, Hair’ sees him return to the cymbal in jagged conversation with a village green were rhythm is tone and vice-versa.

   "name": "Ellen Arkbro uses a rare renaissance organ to emulate a sort of slow, gauzy blues music in the gently compelling organ and brass of her debut album. Arguably one of the most striking, drone-related records of recent years, ‘For Organ and Brass’ should be unmissable to anyone following Ellen or her peers and collaborators, Caterina Barbieri and Kali Malone, or indeed the exalted tones of her Just Intonation tutor, La Monte Young . Unfolding in two meditative, durational parts written for 17th century organ, horn, trombone and microtonal tuba, Ellen’s debut side puts her studies at the Royal College of Music in Sweden to enchanting use in the titular piece’s 20 minutes of glacial movement, and to beautifully smudged, gauzy and intimate appeal recalling Arthur Russell’s ‘Tower Of Meaning’ in the shorter span of ‘Three’. They were both recorded in St Stephanskirche in Tangermünde, Germany, which was specially sought out by Ellen for its Sherer-Orgel, a rare 1624 model with a specific kind of historical tuning known as meantone temperament, as she explains; “Hidden within the harmonic framework of the Renaissance organ are intervals and chords that bare a close resemblance to those found in the modalities of traditional blues music…The work can be thought of as a very slow and reduced blues music.” While the religious links between 17th C Germany church music and early blues are historically implied, it’s maybe trickier to imagine their aesthetic links until you’ve heard ‘For Organ and Brass’. And while they may not be immediate, there’s something of a lingering, spectral link between the two, as though she’s transmuted the blues into slowly intoxicating airs, firstly with the funereal pace and cadence of her title part, and then in a way that perhaps draws links from blues thru country, to Arthur Russell’s earliest chamber-like arrangements found on ‘Tower of Meaning’ and ‘Instrumentals, 1974 - Vol. 2’.

At least one leap year cycle since his last album with the GB’s, Sleep Games, right now this one feels like a stygian trudge into bleakest futures, operating at such a stoned pace that it moves slower than actual time, and by submitting to its temporal warp we’re allowed to regress back into a pre-digital epoch of paranoid cold, or even civil war atmospheres and paranoia. It could almost be the soundtrack to a Ben Wheatley flick (low budget, not the over-glossy high rise) about British time travellers, forgoing Dr. Who queso for a more hard-boiled, furtive vibe about anachronistic assassins sent back to kill Nigel Farage at birth, only to uncover that he’s part of an exceedingly dangerous non-human race with ties to Johnson, Cameron and all the other pebble-people, so they round them all up and lock them in a hostel in Middlesbrough with a broken kettle and packet of poisoned monster munch between the lot. Of course, that fantasy is all set to a soundtrack of wistful electronic mists and pulsating arpeggios that could be right out of some late ‘70s / early ‘80s synth library, and ultimately shows that whilst technology has advanced in the meantime, that ostensibly archaic music still reflects an underlying eldritch darkness contemporary and relevant to both eras, then and now. less"

Turman first came to cult prominence as a member of Boyd Rice’s NON, before going on to enjoy a sporadic solo career that has taken in DAF/Normal-style electronics (Way Down) and superior noise outings (Blizzard, with Aaron Dilloway). Flux, which Turman self-released on cassette, is a one-off – a patient investigation of classical minimalism and new age tropes, an attempt to create “a complex bed of interweaving micro-stasis” with kalimba, piano, drum machine, and tape loops. The results are certainly sparse and meditative, but they’re also deeply engaging, and occasionally unsettling. We’re particularly into ‘Flux 4’, its marriage of plaintive piano and cotton-wool wrapped kickdrum coming over like a precursor to the Miasmah label or those early Dettinger records on Kompakt.

   "name": "Caspar Brötzmann is one of the most unique and innovative guitarists of the last 40 years. With his Berlin-based trio Massaker, he evolved a whole new autonomous approach to writing rock songs, starting from sounds that were widely considered ornamental if not detrimental ‘sonic waste’, such as shrieking feedback and droning overtones. This plethora of sounds were arranged into tracks to sound like breaking concrete, grinding metal, or bursting glass, at once monumental and threatening, impenetrable and hermetic, yet also archaically tender and loving. \"Even today, as the art of noise has reached a level of sophistication that no one could have imagined 30 years ago, Caspar Brötzmann Massaker’s music is resoundingly singular. Ultra heavy riffs and beats, ominous tribal chants and a raw physical force is conjured up by these three sinister and proud minds of their era. Their unhinged, unified stream of energy is captured on these remastered reissues and the results are thrilling. Originally released in 1992, Der Abend der schwarzen Folklore is the third Massaker album, released by Rough Trade Germany. According to Caspar Brötzmann, the title track and “Bass Totem“ are the band’s most accomplished songs. It’s certainly the most sonicly refined of their albums, recorded during a residency over several weeks at the pastoral site of Conny Plank’s studio near Cologne, and produced by Ingo Krauss and Bruno Gebhard, who had worked with the famed Krautrock producer until his death in 1987. Not least, ...Schwarzen Folklore also features their new drummer Danny Lommen, whom Caspar and bassist Eduardo Delgado had headhunted at a concert with Lommen’s Dutch prog-core band Gore. Lommen shared their tastes in sheer volume and presence, and “has a completely unique sound to his drumming“, as Caspar marvels, “he plays ultrahard and clear, with authority and no compromise, nothing, not even the most turbulent and speedy beats, sound fuzzy - a statement.“ This, he adds with a smile, would sometimes lead to intense moods during rehearsals, when he overpowered - no small feat - competing with the sounds of Caspar’s guitar. The Tribe and Black Axis were still if very loosely rooted in some kind of heavy rock. Der Abend der Schwarzen Folklore erases these residues from their genetic make-up - evolving into a free-form noise, strangely motionless like an earthquake rumble, that sounded like nothing else at the time. The opening title song gives the best example with its densely shifting chunk of howling and screaming guitar shreds and grimly determined rumbles from the bass, accented by heavy single beats or massively rattling, yet transparent outbursts from the drums. An impenetrable sense of threat fills the sound, interrupted only by breaks of skinny brooding, giving way to Caspar’s throaty growl evoking a lonely march through hostile wastelands under flaming sunsets. Culminating in an archaic choir chanting about black walls rising - a monstrous cloud of thick high-voltage tension. Caspar speaks of the heavy nature of the lyrics, inspired by 19th century artist Caspar David Friedrich’s painting “Das Eismeer“ (“The Sea of Ice“) which depicts a shipwreck the icy shores of Antarctica. It deals, of course, with ideas of the sublime in nature - but also “the end of hope“, as the painting was known until the sixties. And indeed, Caspar credits his dark and brooding sounds to the uneasy times. With the wall down, the Eastern block broken, East and West Germany were politically united but emotionally didn’t share much more than a certain angst and uneasiness with respect to the future - which erupted in ugly right-wing riots and violence. Caspar felt the rise of a black folklore that he wanted to address, though he never admitted to it at the time because, he said, he didn’t want to sound like “some naive romantic“. Not underestimating the music‘s gothic values - a weird idea, once you’ve listened to “Schwarze Folklore“. less"

In addition to John Barry’s spellbinding original score, several pieces of popular music can be heard throughout the film transmitting from a portable radio, an obvious symbol of western civilization as the protagonists wander disorientated in the ancient tribal Australian wilderness. Here we have documented one of these tracks on limited edition 7” vinyl, a forgotten slice of late 60s lysergic studio-psych from the New York singer-songwriter Billy Mitchel. Produced by Brooks Arthur (Holy Mountain Soundtrack), Electronic Dance is a whirling mix of Indian raga, heavy jazz drums, buzzing electronics and tape collage melding into blue-eyed soul folk from the Woodstock scene.

From Suzanne Kraft's sparse atmospherics that have become more apparent in his new SK U KNO project to Jordan GCZ’s free flowing hardware jams. Parrish Smith showed his contemplative side and sparse orchestrations that he demonstrated on his RE:VIVE release, Genesis Black, a sonic departure from his bombastic releases and DJ-sets while upsammy showed yet again her deft hand for melody and texture, a style that dominates all her releases to date. These four scores can live apart from their films, fitting seamlessly into each artists' growing catalogs of work. But when combined, it’s as if the films and music were made simultaneously with the artist and filmmaker together in the same room.

   "name": "Southern Lord announce the next Caspar Brötzmann Massaker reissues in the ongoing series, continuing with Der Abend Der Schwarzen Folklore and Koksofen this July. Read on for more insight into these albums, and for information about incoming live dates supporting Sunn O))). \"Caspar Brötzmann is one of the most unique and innovative guitarists of the last 40 years. With his Berlin-based trio Massaker, he evolved a whole new autonomous approach to writing rock songs, starting from sounds that were widely considered ornamental if not detrimental ‘sonic waste’, such as shrieking feedback and droning overtones. This plethora of sounds were arranged into tracks to sound like breaking concrete, grinding metal, or bursting glass, at once monumental and threatening, impenetrable and hermetic, yet also archaically tender and loving. Even today, as the art of noise has reached a level of sophistication that no one could have imagined 30 years ago, Caspar Brötzmann Massaker’s music is resoundingly singular. Ultra heavy riffs and beats, ominous tribal chants and a raw physical force is conjured up by these three sinister and proud minds of their era. Their unhinged, unified stream of energy is captured on these remastered reissues and the results are thrilling. Koksofen (which translates as blast furnace), originally released in 1993, has become one of Massaker’s most popular albums. Like it’s predecessor, ...Schwarzen Folklore, the album took shape in Massaker’s rehearsal room below the Berlin subway station Schlesisches Tor, and was recorded at Conny Plank’s studio near Cologne, with Plank’s former associates Ingo Krauss and Bruno Gephard producing. There’s a different kind of intensity to Koksofen. The features of Massaker’s sound are in full bloom. Mountainous noises tower up and crash down, and tormented sounds rise from ominously seething grounds, haunting the entire song-scape. The feel of doom and dread hangs heavily over the five songs, and the title song rumbles, shrieks and wails, plagued by Caspar’s guttural growls of war, suffering and death. Caspar recalls one anecdote from shortly after the original release whereby Bassist Edu Delgado called him asking to turn on the TV, thus discovering that “Hymne“ was being used as background music to a report about the death penalty in the US. A different kind of intensity indeed. Reflecting on the album to this day Caspar remarks “Koksofen is still a mystery to me,'' he continues “I can still feel the troubled times in these songs.” - the effects are certainly potent for the listener too. And the album undoubtedly affirms Massaker as the fiercely original and compellingly raw musicians that they are. less"

While it’s quite possible this uplift in energy may leave some of DeepChord’s older audience out of wind, for many others it’s a breath of fresh air to his exhaustively explored style. Through a simple gesture of pushing the tempo, Modell’s sound instantly becomes more urgent, as though woken from its sluggish reverie and now properly up for some aerobic mysticism. Along with the Chain Reaction nods, there’s clear reference to classic Detroit and related gear, from Mike Grant’s Black Noise to full flight Mills trax and Convextion at his paciest. However, Modell’s grasp of layered, subaquatic dynamics really places ‘Captagon’ in a league of its own, with a rinsed out and rinseable dynamic and traction brilliantly transposed from his fathoms deep catalogue of cv313, Echospace, and DeepChord productions with inexorable velocity.

Across seamlessly segued sides, they weave strategies and logic from the GRM to soil dynamics and avant-classical skools in a remarkable diffusion and collection of energies, swaying in viscous grit one second, then waltzing with Richard Youngs-like folk vocals that bifurcate into dramatic polyphony the next minute, before stranding you in a lift with beelzebub chatting shite in tongues about the weather the next, only to expectorate your head and anticipations in scenes of gunky pastoralism and Noz-like feedback loops of choral vocals and windswept bleeps.

   "name": "Sound poet and multidisciplinary artist Félicia Atkinson follows 2017’s cherished ‘Hand In Hand’ album with this spellbinding study on loneliness and intimacy, crafted while pregnant and on tour. Félicia notably draws Sunn 0)))’s Stephen O’Malley into her meso plane on the collaborative 19 minute closing cut ‘Des Pierres’, a quietly startling end to another captivating album from one of the most interesting minds working on the contemporary scene, perfectly encapsulating a sense of uneasy calm in the midst of so much global uncertainty. To enter any Felicia Atkinson album is to give yourself up to another world where perceptions of time and space subliminally become short-circuited and synaesthetic. Combining illusive electro-acoustic process and meticulously tactile vocals reciting poetry, Felicia’s music rarely fails to provide anything other than an intoxicating experience, and her powers of perception appear to be uniquely attuned on ‘The Flower And The Vessel’. As she states; “this is not a record about being pregnant, it’s a record made with pregnancy”, and as such the results are more ambiguous, riddled with a cosmic web of references to musical memory and onotology, as much as nature and the strange subtleties of the everyday. The album’s theme of loneliness while touring has historically provided much grist to the artistic mill over the years, but rather than tales of excess and depression, Félicia handles her subject matter more meditatively, using small gestures such as “recording my voice, recording birds, a simple melody” to locate her place in the foreign worlds around her, and in the process answer the questions “What am I doing here? How can I connect to the world?”. The first 10 tracks are barely watermarked with her presence, with opener ‘L’Après-Midi’ acting as a poetic diary entry, where she fills in subsequent pages with a mix of notes both metaphorical and musical, from the unsettling intimations of ’Shirley to Shirley’ inward-spiralling vocals of ‘You Have to Have Eyes’, to the micro-to-macro contemplation ‘Linguistics of the Atom’, while album highlights ‘Lush’ and ‘L’Enfant Et Le Poulpe’ speak to a elusive sense of the pastoral, perhaps as viewed form a distance. When she finally does meet another tangible soul, Stephen O’Malley, in the 18 minute finale ‘Des Pierres’, it’s testament to both her own vision and O’Malley’s tactile range that his harmoniously strung-out contribution is so seamlessly woven into her parallel dimension, that you may need to be reminded he’s there, sublimated in-the-mix. less"

Whether it’s preparing instruments like playing a trumpet underwater or through a kazoo, using belt-driven motors and mechanical components to perform cumbersome yet surprisingly musical operations on traditional instruments and household items, or using a fan to hit the strings of a kundi harp with flowing paper - Bastien’s love for tone, rhythm, noise and harmony is poetically reflected across his quite extensive oeuvre. Playful and melancholic, the sound sculptures that Bastien invents and plays with are partly inspired by the work of Raymond Roussel, a visionary French author who at the turn of the 20th century wrote a unique form of literature which inspired and guided artists from the surrealist and pataphysical movement and was declared by Michel Foucault as one of structuralism's founding fathers. On that note, the influence of literature and syntax on Bastien’s work cuts all the way through to the palindromes he uses for his track titles - which, much like his machines, infinitely loop. True to it’s adorable title, Tinkle Twang ‘n Tootle is a music box of unfolding whimsical structures, half broken rhythms, detuned harmonies, and fantastical sound collages that evoke a childlike sense of wonder and an urge to explore the spaces in between the sounds.” less"

The result is on a moody and futuristic Concrète tip, full of seething drones, industrial clangs and flute choruses coming in and out of view. Featuring an hour of new and previously unreleased work, the material here extends as one continuous piece split into two sides, building from meticulously layered field recordings into sheets of drone that coalesce from barely audible murmurations into colossal, reverberant walls of sound. Through a wide and spacious stereo field, we’re led though highly disorientating, sometimes terrifying passages, with long atmospheric sections suddenly disrupted by clanging percussion and found sound panning across the spectrum, before falling back into a kind of deadly, tense fizz. Almost entirely beatless - except for the odd percussive shudder - it’s a relentlessly moody hour of music that only lets in some light at the very end, where buried strings slowly emerge into a gloriously moving final sequence, where shapes and colour gradually thaw back into being.

A lock groove is one cycle of one groove on a record.This is 1.8 sec cut at 33RPM and 1.33 cut at 45RPM. Corker used the cutting lathe currently residing in the living room of The Exchange mastering legend Graeme Durham to experiment with different sounds cut onto acetate and then recorded over different durations back into a computer. Because of the softness of the acetate the lock grooves break down as they are re-recorded causing unexpected effects as the needle carves away the surface of the vinyl. This generative process adds layers of unpredictable noise culminating finally in white noise. These are combined and edited forming frames for performances of violin, percussion and piano. The pieces reflect on the tension between the mechanical and the human gesture/expression and place where they merge.” less"

Hailing from an area oilrich in seminal artists - Autechre, Muslimgauze, Shackleton, Demdike Stare - and where you’re also likely to see blokes tossing off to train commuters in the morning (happened to us a few weeks ago outside Rochdale, no lie), the anonymous NMB collective also draw from this Pennine spirit to create dark, crunching, rhythm-driven electronics. Like previous volumes which variously referenced local bus routes (including used tickets), industry, and utilities, this one follows suit with the ’NWH2O’ EP to go nostalgic for British Gas North West in five tracks of lunky rhythm and sore electronics that patently resonate with the rest of the Skam cabal’s output. In that sense, ‘Moko’ sounds like a bit like a lost offcut from ‘Confield’, and the thrumming slow slam of ‘FRBounces’ could almost be from recent Æ batches, but also fringes on grey area-compatible styles, while the ruggedly barren scape of ‘Safebliss 53Cond P455’ recalls early Pendle Coven, however we’ve never heard any of them do pendulous dancehall rhythms quite like on the zinging ‘Jussbassoneandone’ and the churning bruxist chew of ‘Stelcore 2 (Nabz_& Cluff Version)’, which is strong examples of those crafty aspects to NMB that distinguishes them from the main Skam corpus. less"

   "name": "Titans of UK rave culture, Fabio & Grooverider look back on ’30 Years of Rage’, their seminal London club night, with the first of four volumes charting the ultra-classic and hard-to-find foundations of hardcore, jungle and D&B - the UK’s greatest gift to the world of the past generation. It’s impossible to overstate the influence of Fabio & Grooverider on UK music and rave culture since they began DJing in the late ‘80s acid house phase. For a generation of UK yoof they are practically household names, and we very fondly remember tuning in to their (now defunct) BBC Radio 1 show to catch D&B before we could legally get into clubs. It’s also probably fair to say they’ve done more for race and cultural relations in the UK than any politician ever has, with their earliest, unprecedented fusions of Belgian techno with UK fast rap, Yorkshire bleep, US house, Caribbean soundsystem culture and London rare groove hustle laying a template that frankly revolutionised dancefloors across the country, bringing people together in the same space who were, to a much greater extent than today, largely, mutually exclusive. We could bang on about their importance all day, but suffice it to say they are the OG’s of UK rave. As the label explain, their RAGE night was arguably the ground zero for Jungle. \"The party was started at London's cavernous Heaven club by Fabio & Grooverider in 1988, at the height of Acid House fever that was making it's way up and down the motorways, slip-roads, fields and warehouses of the M25 and further beyond every weekend, troubling the nation, the police, your parents and the press as it went. RAGE was a different beast, it certainly channelled some of that Acid energy but pitted it against the new and exciting sounds emanating from Belgium, Amsterdam, Detroit, Sheffield, Essex and Hackney and in turn created a new style, a new sonic attitude and energy in the process. Rumbling bass-lines, narcotic synth rushes and roughly chopped and sped-up breakbeats all merged into a style that we now know as Jungle.\" This first volume is a tour de force of early rave pressure, charting a course from Leftfield’s deep 1990 bass massage ‘Not Forgotten’ thru Lennie De Ice’s all-time jungle cornerstone ‘We Are IE’, the London mash-up styles of ‘Dubplate’ by Wots My Code, Foul Play’s artful jungle masterpiece ‘Being With You’, and the bawl fwd hardcore of ‘The Future’ by Noise Factory, saving Fallout’s lip-smacking classic ‘The Morning After (Sunrise Mix)’ for dessert.

The Eternal kicks off in a violent storm; an \"out-of-the gate hardcore matinee track\" as Thurston Moore would have it, fronted by an on-form, ageless Kim Gordon. The sublime proto-grunge riffology carries over into 'Anti-Orgasm'; a barrage of arch feminist-punk sloganeering that divides itself into two halves, the first presenting a snarling line-up of guitars while the second ebbs into a carefully poised kraut-surf rock soundscape. Sounding every bit like a modern SY classic, 'Antenna' maintains sufficient abrasion via some nerve-jangling guitar manipulations, while surly Mark Ibold basslines prop up the Lee Ranaldo-fronted 'What We Know', and the excellent 'Malibu Gas Station' mires itself in a sinister sleaziness - \"an ode to the flash moment of the camera as you knowingly step from your SUV sans panties\" appropriately delivered with all the nervous confusion of a Britney breakdown. Perhaps a testament to Sonic Youth's own longevity, and all-round status as elder statespeople of subterranean music, large chunks of The Eternal reference and eulogise alternative culture's departed: the sleeve is a painting by guitar great John Fahey, while NYC beat poet Greg Corso is commemorated on 'Leaky Lifeboat', and 'Thunderclap (For Bobby Pyn)' pays tribute to The Germs' frontman Darby Crash - though it could equally be taken as a broader eulogy for LA's post-punk scene of the late '70s and early '80s. Sonic Youth fulfill a great many roles, and in addition to persistently being one of the great bands of our time, The Eternal shows that they're also historians of the underground; a living, working museum to all the obscure bands, sub-scenes and musical tributaries they've come into contact with and drawn influence from (or for that matter, themselves influenced) over a lifespan.

   "name": "Ryuichi Sakamoto’s ravishing and rare solo piano suite ‘BTTB’ is finally issued on vinyl - expanded, reshuffled, and newly replete with liner notes by none other than Haruki Murakami. Trust it’s swoon-worthy stuff. Originally released in 1998 and hard to get hold of outside of Japan, ‘BTTB’, or ‘Back To The Basics’ is now reissued on 2LP to mark its 20th anniversary. It’s effectively a definitive edition of ‘BTTB’, reshuffled from the original 2LP pressing to also include ‘Energy Flow’ from the BTTB’ maxi-single, (which peaked at No.4 in the Japanese singles charts), as well as the slippery elegance of ‘Reversing’, both on the vinyl album for the first time. Tech specs aside, this new edition is a sumptuous testament to Sakamoto’s effortlessly natural, poetic evocations of emotion, by then channelling some 30 years work as an arranger of classic synthpop (YMO, collabs with David Sylvian), and seminal soundtracks (Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence; The Last Emperor) into some of his most stripped down yet affective music, hovering on the line between precise, mindful composition and intuitively fluid improvisation. While the majority of the material here features Sakamoto playing conventionally beautiful solo piano with magnificent highlights on the likes of ‘Opus’, he also extends into experimental, prepared piano on a handful of pieces, both serene and frantic, such as ‘Prelude’, ‘Sonata’ and ‘Uetax’, cannily resonating with Aphex Twin’s prepared piano pieces on ‘Drukqs’, which were released just two years later. less"

   "name": "’Danger in Paradise’ is David Toop & Steve Beresford’s DIY masterpiece of dub-soul experimentation. Originally issued in 1984, and starring doyens of the experimental/improv scene, Lol Coxhill and David Cunningham, General Strike’s sole album remains a massive highlight of its era, epitomising a rich seam of dub, jazz, and post-punk experimentation executed with garden shed means and genteel English eccentricity. David Toop has described Danger In Paradise, an album of material he recorded with Steve Beresford and David Cunningham as General Strike between 1979 and '81, as \"hauntology before its time\". In some sense he's right: some of the queer-pitched electronics and impishly sinister samples on the record wouldn't sound out of place on a Focus Group transmission. But first and foremost, General Strike is a potting shed avant-dub masterpiece, covering enormously wide ground. 'My Other Body' is a beautifully bass-heavy, almost Antena-esque pop original voiced by Dawn Roberts (singing lyrics culled from Foucault's Mental Illness And Psychology), 'Guided Missiles' is nuclear-paranoid doo-wop, and Sun Ra's 'Interplanetary Music' and 'We Travel The Spaceways' are reinterpreted in a way that somehow reconciles their afro-futurist origins with a bimbling, bumbling sensibility unique to Blighty's suburbs. Cunningham's extraordinary tape treatments and the ensemble's anything-could-happen, patchwork approach to composition place the album at a heart of a British DIY tradition that has brought us The Shadow Ring, Flaming Tunes, Cleaners From Venus and This Heat among others (it's no surprise to learn that portions of it were recorded at This Heat's Cold Storage studio space). All in all a terrific, gloriously unusual record - originally issued on cassette by Touch in '84, and later on CD by Piano, this new edition from Staubgold represents its first time on download formats and a first vinyl edition in years. less"

   "name": "First reissue of David Rosenboom’s groundbreaking 1975 experiments in using brain biofeedback to control live electronics, newly expanded with an additional LP containing an unreleased 1977 live recording of Rosenboom’s “On Being Invisible”, in which the composer himself performs on an array of electronics that are fed information from his brainwaves. Another diamond from Black Truffle. David Rosenboom was a key member of that 1970s fraternity of electronic music explorers who prized early forms of live electronic music performance, often seeing it as superior to the laborious process of electronic composition on clunky computers, and much closer to the ultimately expressive forms of classical instrumental virtuosity. With ‘Brainwave Music’ Rosenboom pushed that idea into new dimensions, using electrodes and monitoring devices attached to players in order to receive and gather information about their brainwaves, body temperature, and galvanic skin response, which was then analysed and in turn used to modulate the parameters of his oscillators and filters. In theory, the system allowed for a greater level of connection between the player’s sub/conscious intuition and psychophysiological response, or in-the-moment action. On the A-side’s ‘Portable Gold And Philosophers’ Stone’ this notion manifests as a warbling smudge of phasing, keening microtones as the brainwaves of Pat and Alan Strange and Marilyn and Frank McCarty feed into Rosemboom’s electronic systems in a wholly absorbing and inimitable flurry of ostinatos, eddies and whorls that make our eyes go funny. However, with the B-side’s ‘Chilean Drought’ and ‘Piano Etude I (Alpha)’ he works with Jacqueline Humbert to specifically focus on the three states of brain waves, Alpha, Beta, and Theta at once, with uncanny results that will sound different to each listener depending on their listening environment and mental state, leading their brain to subconsciously pick up on the voices speaking to their mind’s appropriate frequencies. Recorded contemporaneously, Rosenboom’s 1977 previously unreleased live recording of ‘On Being Invisible’ is initially, aesthetically closest to the A-side of ‘Brainwave Music’, but find Rosenboom better getting to grips with his system, with immeasurably intricate, complex results that sound like a pre-echo of Florian Hecker’s acid trax one minute, and like Dolphin chatter the next, then like intercepted alien transmissions. Suffice it to say this was the first record of it kind, and a truly historic piece of electronic composition. less"

Where his ‘Disruptive Muzak’ piece adapted the early hacking technique of “phreaking” - manipulating telephone exchanges - his two new works logically follow with a signature mixture of mischief and uncanny insight, suggesting super crafty ways to subvert AI voice recognition and simulate a rave in a server centre. “First exhibited at EBM(T) in Tokyo, Live @ Google Data Center trespasses in Google’s data centre in Council Bluffs, Iowa to perform electronic music amongst the humming banks of servers and endless cable runs, without actually breaking in. In a process he describes as “mimetic hacking,” Kidel used architectural plans based on photos of the data centre to acoustically model the sonic qualities of the space. The resulting acoustics on Live @ Google Data Center simulate the sound of Kidel’s algorithmically-generated notes, rhythms and melodies reverberating through the space, as though a bold illegal party was being held in the maximum security location. The generative audio patch Kidel used to make the B-side, Voice Recognition DoS Attack seeks to disable the functionality of voice recognition software by triggering phonemes (the smallest units of language). The project, first developed for the Eavesdropping series of events in Melbourne, exploits a weakness in voice recognition that cannot distinguish between individual voices. When you speak while the patch is playing, the cascading shards of human expression mask your speech and thus protect you from automated surveillance, questioning our vulnerability in the face of global data giants. In amongst these displaced sounds, Kidel fed additional musical elements into his patch to create the version of the project heard on this release.” less"

Bobbing gently in the wake of 2017’s ‘An Act of love’ and ‘A Restless Gaze’ outings, Earthen Sea’s ‘Grass and Trees’ channels a liminal mix of spatialized, organically warm-sounding tones that run into each with the quality of watercolours, as characterised in the sleeve art. But where previous Earthen Sea outings were yoked to a regular pulses, there’s a finer push and pull of syncopated, latinate rhythms that works under the surface of ‘Grass and Trees’, lending the whole album a delicious slink that pulls listeners right into its wavey motion. Fans of Gas, Strategy, Beatrice Dillon, or even those breezy Werkbund bits, need apply! “Jacob Long's reductionist rhythmic ambient vessel, Earthen Sea, ebbs towards a more purely elemental state on his second excursion for Kranky, Grass and Trees. He describes the creative process as one of \"simplifying things as much as possible,\" designing uncluttered spaces traced in nothing but breath, field recordings, and \"sounds that could be played by hand but weren't.\" The results feel decentralized but dynamic, low-lit evocations of ambiguous nocturnal environments - dub techno disassembled into stray pulses and spare parts. It's a music both interior and infinite, languorous yet transformative, made in the outer boroughs of a metropolis but attuned to its own liminal wilderness. Long's vision is a grounding one, rooted in the physical body but attuned to larger currents: \"In response to living in a fairly hectic city, and at a very hectic time for the world at large, creating something more drawn back and restrained felt appropriate.\" less"

Where previous outings have been partly defined by Standish’s plaintive vocals, they contrarily don’t appear until the closing strokes on this one, as they roll out 9 minutes of horizontally-inclined vibes in ‘Eyes On Ceiling’ with its sonorous 808s and shallow plasmic dubbing recalling a long soak in the bath that’s starting to lose its heat, before ‘Husk’ emerges into balmier air streaked with filigree electronics, shimmering pads and a pleading sax that paves the way to a very Mark Hollis-esque denouement. less"

   "name": "Our album of the year 2018 is Eli Keszler’s ‘Stadium'; an isolationist avant-jazz masterpiece that's both highly complex and entirely accessible. With his close collaborators Daniel ‘0PN’ Lopatin and Laurel Halo smoking in the back seat, on ‘Stadium’ Keszler somehow manages to emulate a feeling of being lost in a crowd, of time slowing down as the world accelerates around you. In a year full of global upheaval and noise - it was the album that offered us the greatest sanctuary. Painted in diffuse strokes, Keszler offsets rhythmic complexity with spacious Rhodes chords, floating woodwind and field recordings - showing off an expressive grasp of meter and mood while creating a kind of slow-fast simulation that alters your perspective and sense of scale, zooming out from the atomic to a gauzy panoramic view. Keszler navigates webs of sound as structurally fascinating as a spider’s web or a deep space image of a distant constellation, seemingly moving on eight legs along steep vertical and fast-flowing horizontal axes with a shocking grasp of precision and pointillism that will leave new listeners to his work scratching their heads, wondering how to programme such chicanery electronically. But as longer term followers of Keszler’s work know, the magick is all acoustic and haptic; physically converting impressions of images and emotions into overlapping geometries of geography and psychology - and in this case effectively projecting a singular, inverted form of sonic deep topography, if you will. While challenging and highly complex in its construction, it’s an album that's also tremendously easy on the ear, effortlessly binding instrumental dexterity with cool blue harmolodic sentiment in a timeless style that could feasibly be dated to any point between the mid ‘70s heyday of jazz-fusion and right now - in the most thought provoking, evocative way. It reminds us of Milford Graves, Jan Jelinek and even Miles Davis at their most smoked out and moody: best enjoyed alone, late at night. less"

   "name": "PAN’s butterfly net captures IRISIRI, the 3rd solo album by Alex Drewchin a.k.a. Eartheater, who provides the label’s first release of 2018, and one of its most sublime since Yves Tumor’s Serpent Music or the Mono No Aware set. Alexa’s first two Eartheater albums were released at either end of 2015 to critical acclaim - Metalepsis was Fact Mag’s album of the year, and RIP Chrysalis in its top 10 - and this follow-up is a majestic effort balancing a romantic, gothic sense of introspection with wide angled cosmic scope and intuition. Where the first two Eartheater albums formed a tempered concision of her psychedelic improvisations as frontwoman of the Guardian Alien ensemble, IRISIRI offers a more shattered looking glass perspective on Alexa Drewchin’s personal sound, each track resolving richly colourful mosaics of strings, synths and electronics riddled with trance motifs and her own three octave-range voice, itself an instrument of myriad potential, morphing from xanny mumble to angelic ambient pop tropes and keening wails. IRISIRI stealthily casts its spell in 13 succinct sections, seamlessly flowing in a deceptively freehanded style from the harp strokes and bubbling bong of Peripheral thru something like blunted rap on Inclined, then making canny use of a Robert Miles sample in the K-holed maze of MTTM, and meshing Harthouse pulses with harps in Curtains, before going full blown Clannad in Trespasses, and tagging in Moor Mother for the fractious MMXXX, and pulling out with the teeny American angst of C.L.I.T., and a computerised meditation on OS In Vitro. The overall effect of IRISIRI is seductive and layered with enough detail to keep us heading back for further investigation. less"

   "name": "After 23 years out of print, FSOL’s definitive early ‘90s ambient-epic Lifeforms now returns to its natural habitat. Serving near-dangerous levels of nostalgia for almost anyone who came thru in the ‘90s, Lifeforms is set to soundtrack myriad afterparties and claim its place on a whole new generation of record shelves. Originally released in 1994, a few years after FSOL had become a household name thanks to their debut LP Accelerator and its standout rave anthem, Papua New Guinea (and not forgetting Humanoid’s Stakker before it), Brian Dougans and Garry Cobain’s project really blossomed into something else with Lifeforms, where they consolidated a wealth of esoteric ideas and philosophies into what was effectively a new manifesto for psychedelic electronic music. Whether unconsciously and osmotically absorbed, or dutifully studied and cherished by those cognisant of its brilliance, Lifeforms was almost unavoidably ubiquitous at the time, and inarguably worked its way into the popular consciousness in a way that electronic records rarely do nowadays. It was definitely a product of its time, and now, 23 years later, we can safely say it’s kept its charms intact. Riffing on then-emergent themes of cybernetics, amorphous androgyny and artificial intelligence, together with nods to classic ‘70s psychedelia and kosmische - it features guest spots from Ozric Tentacles and Robert Fripp, and sampled Klaus Schulze - the results tapped into the era’s undercurrent of aerobic mysticism and eldritch new age spirituality to locate an unprecedented confluence of those styles which has influenced swathes of electronic dreamers ever since. It’s techno-romantic and tech-gnostic in the lushest sense, a utopian beauty flush with the thrill of unknown futures, yet fringed with an MDMA come-down melancholy that’s totally crucial to understanding that era’s play and juxtaposition of energies. Quite simply, though: Lifeforms is an incredibly enigmatic and life-affirming album awaiting your (re)discovery. less"

   "name": "PAN’s arch electro-acoustic se’er reveals a new solo masterwork of filigree detail, mercurial movement and abyssal psychological insight with Clonic Earth, arriving two years since Miseri Lares gouged an irreparable hole in our listening lives. Clonic Earth represents a surreal, allegorical study on the metaphysics and ontology of fire and its importance to life; reflecting a flux between states of vital, energy-giving convulsion and perpetual entropic decay thru the textural communications of a plethora of swarming, disembodied voices and abstracted, flammable sonics. Under a title referring to a type of seizure, or involuntary rapid contraction and expansion of a muscle, Clonic Earth forms a sort of waking nightmare that oscillates between pensive tranquility, out-of-body atmospheric pressure drops and free falling chaos, all punctuated by the aural equivalent of hypnic jerks - those startling spasms that spark and moderate the liminal boundary between waking and dream life. The presence of choral voices, which no doubt speak to Tricoli’s roots in Catholic south Italy, lends a liturgical gravity to proceedings yet never weighs it down; instead, like the myriad birdcalls and his own voice, they provide snagging points of contrast, or pivots around which the amorphous mass of estranged references coagulate and diffuse, uprooting and translating their meaning into an intangible grammar of elemental chaos and complexity. PAN evocatively compare the album with a large Hieronymous Bosch painting, which is quite right in terms of its rolling scale and sense of perspective, telescoping between the crackling embers of hell in the near-otoacoustic intro of The Hallowed Receiver and the transition from church bells to sooty caverns and voice-inside-your-head moans of As For The Crack with an effortless that belies the meticulous micro/macro-organisms at work between the eyes, under the skin of this incredible beast. This is the kind of record that makes others in its field pale in significance, and is probably only matched right now for levels of ingenuity and vision by elements of the recent Autechre album, but even then Tricoli is still well out on his own. Huge recommendation. less"

   "name": "It’s been 20 years since we heard Smog’s ’Spanish Moss’ for the first time and every Bill Callahan record since has f#cked us up. This is his first new one in years and is quite possibly his best. Supremely beautiful music... \"As you listen to ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’, a feeling of totality, of completeness, steals over you, like a thief in broad daylight. Of course it does - you’re listening to a new Bill Callahan record. The first one in almost six years. First, it’s a different kind of record. Bill’s now writing from somewhere beyond his ‘Eagle’-‘Apocalypse’-‘River’ headspace and ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’ is very much its own beast. The songs are, by and large, shorter and there are more of them. It took almost all of the previous three albums to add up to that many. Plus, twenty’s a lot of songs. After ‘Dream River’, Bill’s life went through some changes. Good changes - marriage and a kid - but afterwards, it was suddenly harder for him to find the place where the songs came, to make him and these new experiences over again into something to sing. His songs have always been elusive, landing lightly between character study and autobiography, as the singer-songwriter often does. This felt different, though. After 20 years of putting music first, he wasn’t prepared to go away from it completely. Or was he? The lives of a newlywed, a new parent, they have so much in them - but writing and singing, it was his old friend that had helped him along to this place where he’d so happily arrived. Was there room for everybody? While sorting it all out, he worked on songs every day - which meant that for a while, there were lots of days simply confronting the void, as he measured this new life against the ones he’d previously known. It informed the shape of the album. Moving gradually from reflections upon the old days in ‘Ballad Of The Hulk’ and ‘Young Icarus’ to the immediacy of the present moment in ‘Watching Me Get Married’ and ‘Son Of The Sea’, Bill traces the different life lines, casually unwinding knotty contradictions and ambiguities with an arresting stillness. The sense of a life thunderstruck by change infuses ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’ - the songs wander from expressions of newfound joy and great contentment to other snapshots, considerations of the not-joy that we all know. Unsettling dream-images and mythic recollections are patiently received; the undertow of the past is resisted, pulling against it instead into the present, accepting revolutions of time and the unconscious as a natural flow. These transcendent expressions are wedded translucently to the music. Acknowledging the uncertainty in which the songs were assembled, Bill went to the studio alone, unsure if he could find what he was looking for with a band riding along - because who knew how long it would take? This allowed the fluidity of his song-thoughts to be laid down with the right feeling. Once there was guitar and vocals, the other parts came. Matt Kinsey’s guitar partnership is an essential relationship within the music, as is Brian Beattie’s acoustic bass - but also, Bill found himself overdubbing parts himself for the first time in many years, which lent the songs an episodic drift, as if he’s passing through rooms while singing. In its final mix, ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’ glows incandescent - an entirely acoustic arrangement, sounds and stories shifting seamlessly, almost like one big song made of a bunch of new stories - the kind that only Bill Callahan thinks to sing. It’s a joy to hear from this old friend - informing all the lives that we’ve led in the hearing.\" less"

Cherry picked by legendary rave figureheads Fabio & Grooverider, Parts 3+4 spend their last barrels of badness in a patented mix of Hi-Tek Detroit soul, foundation-shaking bleep ’n bass and unmissable rushes of hardcore junglist brilliance that still works the pants off any ‘floor worth its bassbins. For anyone over the age of 30 in the UK, whether absorbed osmotically or ingested religiously, it’s a deeply familiar sound that has reverberated from cars, radios, clubs, fields and warehouses for a lifetime, and still supplies a bounty of inspiration to new generations of ravers searching for *that* sensation. We start with Landlord’s foundational anthem ’I Like It (Blow Out Dub)’ - responsible for the heavily-sampled “Landlord” riff - is locked and loaded next to the eccie-triggering Detroit classic ‘Straight Outta Hell (Hellhound Mix)’ by Tronikhouse, and the ruddy swagger of 33 1/3 Queen’s bugged-out killer ‘Searchin’’, which Fabio & Grooverider call “One of the best tunes of the ‘90s. Superb” We head to a deeper flex with the tucked hustle of Richie Rich’s spooked ‘Salsa House’ and the crispy, breaks-driven rave soul of Debbie Malone’s ‘Rescue Me (Club Mix)’, before rounding off with Neon’s Belgian rave staple ‘Don’t Mess With This Beat (Instrumental Mix)’, which would come to serve ‘core elements to 2 Bad Mice, while FSOL’s ‘Papua New Guinea’ surely brings a tear to the eye. There’s some outright all-time classics on the knockout one-two of Brainkillers’ deeeep jungle bullet ‘Screwface’ and an early appearance from Basement Jaxx’s Simon Ratcliffe as Tic Tac Toe with ‘Ephemerol’, while the final side leaves us a mess with Ability II’s seminal ‘Pressure Dub’ into the pie-eyed innocence of ‘Don’t Go’ by Awesome 3.

   "name": "The Last Wave (also known as Black Rain in the US) was the final chapter in a trilogy of films scripted and directed by the leading auteur of the Australian New Wave, Peter Weir. With no LP issued after the films premiere in 1977, and together with the mystery surrounding the true identity of its enigmatic composer ‘Charles Wain’, the score is a largely unheard recording of pioneering experimental film electronics, easily compared to the music that contemporaries Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream were composing for Australian films during the same period or the electronic soundtracks of John Carpenter. \"Beginning in 1974 with the absurdist black comedy-horror The Cars That Ate Paris, and followed a year later by the lush gothic mystery Picnic At Hanging Rock, The Last Wave was a landmark in existential horror. Sitting alongside other Australian eco-terror films (e.g. Long Weekend) the film featured a haunting electronic soundtrack that is as mysterious and beguiling as the spiritual themes of the film itself. Tense atonal electronics, synthesizer drones and manipulated Didjeridu all perfectly capture the film’s ominous atmosphere, punctuating the slow hypnotic pace of this brooding supernatural thriller.

The big highlights are the EP’s balmiest and jazziest bits, namely the dusky blue strut of ‘Alternative Theme From Gay Men’s Guide To Safer Sex’ that opens the EP, along with the iridescent shimmies of ‘Exploding Frogs’ and its rework ‘Omlagus Garfungiloops’, which could almost be a fantasy collaboration between Japanese Electronics-era Heinrich Mueller and Angelo Badalamenti at his most snake-hipped and winking.

   "name": "Huerco S’ West Mineral Ltd label returns with this spellbinding debut of subtropical, Afro-Latinate jazz ambience from Mister Water Wet, a mentor of sorts to Brian Leeds aka Huerco S. It’s a richly evocative tapestry of sound that reminds us of listening to Gescom’s ‘Disengage’ radio show, infused with bits of interference and fizzing Exotika, or like Move D’s KM20 era recordings slowly disolving into the Conet Project’s noise station recordings via Ramzi’s asymmetric bliss. Revealing Mister Water Wet’s music for the first time beyond his circle of friends, ‘Bought The Farm’ yields a highly atmospheric spirit guided by a first thought, best thought intuition through 55 minutes of crackly, hand-built music riddled with ephemeral soul. In terms of texture and structure, it’s a sound that can also be compared with Jan Jelinek at his most frayed and slompy, or even a pastoral inversion of Kelman Duran’s rugged chop ’n paste arrangements, essentially rendering a distinctive style that hovers between heavy-lidded, Afro-Latinate jazz, exotik instrumentation, and strains of gently bucolic, ambient introspection. Although based in Kansas City, Mister Water Wet spends a lot of time with his pops in Puerto Rico, and the subtropical natural world and revolutionary politics of the Caribbean islands osmotically informs ‘Bought The Farm.’ In 10 parts ranging from zoned-out drifts to pockets of sweetly psychedelic delirium, Mister Water Wet uses a patented blend of found artefacts and dusty magick to literally and metaphysically connote his conception of a spiritual home, framing a portal from where he can “speak” to Pedro Albizu Campos, a leading figure of the Puerto Rican independence movement, while immersing listeners in his lushly verdant, oasis-like “bosques”, or naturally sprawling woodlands and iridescent rivulets of sound. It’s a beautifully modest and intimate expression of ideas heard through the prism of the lands and spirits that shaped it. From the aeolian bleeps of ‘Walking West’ to the flutes snagged in the breeze of ‘Gadaduman Trades’, atavistic traces of the natural world and ancient traditions lead into moments of heart-rending dreaminess in the humble centrepiece of burnished drums and dream pop diva called ‘Dart’, before flowing out into oceanic new age with ‘Cuevas’, whereas highlights such as ‘Drought’ feel like a wood-fired interlude for BoC, and the heat curdled jazz-fusion of ‘Gills’ gives way to a memorably sublime parting statement in ’Sarah Sleeping.’ Sublime, psychedelic music. less"

   "name": "Björk blooms her most impressive album in a good while with Utopia, featuring co-production by Arca and even a guest spot by Rabit, who both aid in buoying her astonishingly lush and romantic new song cycle. As sincerely optimistic as the title may suggest, Utopia is, by Björk’s own description, her “tinder album”, projecting a positive answer to the tortuous soul-searching of Vulnicura. We can take or leave a lot of Björk on most days. But this one got us right thurrr. Whether that’s due to the seamless integration of Arca’s virtuosic flourishes, it’s difficult to say. However, the embrace of space and nature, both real and emulated, within Utopia lends an intoxicatingly out-of-body sensation to its songs which beautifully leavens her sometimes overwrought delivery, serving to free up her spirit in the most literal and fascinatingly intangible terms. Where Arca was brought in at the late stages of Vulnicura to warp its edges, their working relationship immediately spilled over into the recording of Utopia, forging a symbiotic and hugely fruitful relationship with the artist he formerly called his idol. Now creative partners, their powers are multiplied, manifesting the longest single piece of work in either’s catalogue, and arguably their most seductive. You can literally hear her beaming while she sings over swooping subs, gamer FX and pirouetting harps in Awakening My Senses, whilst the folk phrasing and prettiness of Blissing Me perfectly counters her operatic tendencies. Conversely, the adroit looseness of Arca’s rhythms acutely mirror the expressive meter of Björk’s classical inflections in Body Memory, one of the album’s longest, most immersive highlights, and equally in sweetly fractious form to giddy effect on Losss, which benefits from Rabit’s push ’n pull production. And even when talking frankly about the darker side of that tinder life in the couplet of Courtship and Sue Me, she pulls off delirious, rugged - but not overbearing - rhythms and skyward-zipping flutes keeping her spirit decidedly up and forward-looking in a way that also informs the album’s heart-cupping conclusion, Future Forever. less"

For a generation of UK yoof they are practically household names, and we very fondly remember tuning in to their (now defunct) BBC Radio 1 show to catch D&B before we could legally get into clubs. It’s also probably fair to say they’ve done more for race and cultural relations in the UK than any politician ever has, with their earliest, unprecedented fusions of Belgian techno with UK fast rap, Yorkshire bleep, US house, Caribbean soundsystem culture and London rare groove hustle laying a template that frankly revolutionised dancefloors across the country, bringing people together in the same space who were, to a much greater extent than today, largely, mutually exclusive. We could bang on about their importance all day, but suffice it to say they are the OG’s of UK rave. As the label explain, their RAGE night was arguably the ground zero for Jungle. \"The party was started at London's cavernous Heaven club by Fabio & Grooverider in 1988, at the height of Acid House fever that was making it's way up and down the motorways, slip-roads, fields and warehouses of the M25 and further beyond every weekend, troubling the nation, the police, your parents and the press as it went. RAGE was a different beast, it certainly channelled some of that Acid energy but pitted it against the new and exciting sounds emanating from Belgium, Amsterdam, Detroit, Sheffield, Essex and Hackney and in turn created a new style, a new sonic attitude and energy in the process. Rumbling bass-lines, narcotic synth rushes and roughly chopped and sped-up breakbeats all merged into a style that we now know as Jungle.\" This first volume is a tour de force of early rave pressure, charting a course from Leftfield’s deep 1990 bass massage ‘Not Forgotten’ thru Lennie De Ice’s all-time jungle cornerstone ‘We Are IE’, the London mash-up styles of ‘Dubplate’ by Wots My Code, Foul Play’s artful jungle masterpiece ‘Being With You’, and the bawl fwd hardcore of ‘The Future’ by Noise Factory, saving Fallout’s lip-smacking classic ‘The Morning After (Sunrise Mix)’ for dessert. On volume 2 of 4, ravers are spoilt for choice with a selection running from Derrick May’s metallic Detroit funk in ‘Emanon’ to Q Project’s jungle foundation ‘Champion Sound’, taking in Richie Hawtin’s hoover techno classique ‘Technarchy’ as Cybersonik, Ecstasy Club’s acid house anphem ‘Jesus Loves The Acid’, Nightmares On Wax’s Yorkshire bleep ’n bass staple in ‘Aftermath’, and the deadly feminine pressure of ‘Just 4 U London (Kuff Mix)’ by Bodysnatch. Part 3 starts with Landlord’s foundational anthem ’I Like It (Blow Out Dub)’ - responsible for the heavily-sampled “Landlord” riff - is locked and loaded next to the eccie-triggering Detroit classic ‘Straight Outta Hell (Hellhound Mix)’ by Tronikhouse, and the ruddy swagger of 33 1/3 Queen’s bugged-out killer ‘Searchin’’, which Fabio & Grooverider call “One of the best tunes of the ‘90s. Superb” We head to a deeper flex with the tucked hustle of Richie Rich’s spooked ‘Salsa House’ and the crispy, breaks-driven rave soul of Debbie Malone’s ‘Rescue Me (Club Mix)’, before rounding off with Neon’s Belgian rave staple ‘Don’t Mess With This Beat (Instrumental Mix)’, which would come to serve ‘core elements to 2 Bad Mice, while FSOL’s ‘Papua New Guinea’ surely brings a tear to the eye. There’s some outright all-time classics on the knockout one-two of Brainkillers’ deeeep jungle bullet ‘Screwface’ and an early appearance from Basement Jaxx’s Simon Ratcliffe as Tic Tac Toe with ‘Ephemerol’, while the final side leaves us a mess with Ability II’s seminal ‘Pressure Dub’ into the pie-eyed innocence of ‘Don’t Go’ by Awesome 3. Factor in the Detroit galvanic of the Mayday mix for De-Lite’s ‘Wild Times’, and the bolshy brass of ‘Living In Darkness’ by Top Buzz and you have a definitive taste of an unprecedented time and place in UK culture. To use an old Manc term, it’s the fucking lick. Salute Fabio & Grooverider each and every. less"

   "name": "One of the boldest artists merging uncompromising computer music and experimental club music right now, Jung An Tagen returns to Editions Mego with a a thrilling batch of oblique electronics and agitated polyrhythms Claiming space between Florian Hecker, Rian Treanor and Cam Deas’ styles as his own playground, ’ProxyStates’ brilliantly swings between emulations of big-bang sonics in ‘Spill (False)’ thru to parrying electro-techno patterns in ‘Wreath Products (C#, D#)’, and more regular, sleekly rolled out techno pulses on ‘Wreath Products (D#, F#)’, with the strobing knots of ‘Wreath Products (F#, G#)’, and the absolute polychromatic chaos of ‘Compressions in a Chamber of Hard Light’ bound to shred you mind to ribbons in the best way. “All of this is done with his usual fearless but mindful approach. His unique exercises with structure, time and sound create an ecstatic familiarity with the sounds while at the same time inducing a creeping physical alienation. In other words, some parts may be rhythmically infectious, others will give you no chance to immerse. The stimulation is astute and continuous, encouraging an out-of-this-world experience. The main arc of “Proxy States” consists of a 16 against 17 poly-rhythmic synth line that through different intonations of the kick drum always transforms its syntax. This synth line always scales up 1 key, in the middle of the track, foreseeing the upcoming structure. While these tracks (3, 4, 5, 6: “Wreath Products”) follow an almost obsessive-compulsive order, the remaining tracks seem to blow up the structure entirely like the last scenes of the 1970 Michelangelo Antonioni’s film “Zabriskie Point”, creating an event inside the event. “Proxy States” was impossible to press on vinyl but the fast, sharp and wild grooves of Jung An Tagen’s new album are incredibly synched with the concept of an ever accelerating future.” less"

Part 3 in this essential series is a big hit of nostalgia for older heads and equally takes yung gurners to skool with an essential flux of US garage, Detroit techno, and early UK trance-electronica, all remastered and newly cut to vinyl for optimal pressure. On disc 1, Landlord’s foundational anthem ’I Like It (Blow Out Dub)’ - responsible for the heavily-sampled “Landlord” riff - is locked and loaded next to the eccie-triggering Detroit classic ‘Straight Outta Hell (Hellhound Mix)’ by Tronikhouse, and the ruddy swagger of 33 1/3 Queen’s bugged-out killer ‘Searchin’’, which Fabio & Grooverider call “One of the best tunes of the ‘90s.

Worth bearing in mind that at the time, Fabio & Grooverider put their own spin on all these tracks by pitching them up and cutting them together in-the-mix, tying formerly mutually exclusive strands into a syncretic formula which was radical back then and has evidently withstood the test of time.

   "name": "From the label behind the original ‘Oramics’ CD comes possibly one of the strangest (and first) DIY records out of Israel, with Amnon Raviv’s 1983 debut ‘Mirror’ reissued from the original run of 50, finally making this gem available to the world beyond hardened record collectors Frankly and respectfully, Amnon Raviv is a bit of a nutter. Nowadays he’s a professionally accredited Clown Doctor who makes mirth for patients in Tel Aviv cancer wards, and back in 1983 he knocked out one of the most charming and singular LPs of his day, yet you’d be forgiven for being oblivious to its existence as only 50 copies of the LP were made and self-distributed between Tel Aviv record stores. Luckily Paradigm Discs’ Clive Graham received a copy from an Israeli pal in the late ‘80s, and, after a very recent exchange on YouTube, Raviv’s seductively bonkers debut is now in proper circulation for anyone who didn’t live in Tel Aviv or have Israeli mates in the ‘80s. Recorded between his neighbours’ chicken coop, the streets of Tel Aviv, and even in an actual studio, the results swing from fusions of flamenco guitar and violin swaddled in bubbling, underwater sounds, through to genuinely unhinged barnyard frolics and sweltering street scenes, with each part conveying highly personalised and uniquely observed scenarios. The two Flamenco pieces are equally great but markedly different, one free and full of bubbling bucolic promise, and the other ravishingly playful then head-spinningly hot and psychedelic, while the piercing tones of his 2nd piece make uncanny use of crystal glasses, guitar, and varispeed tape to connote sensations of “intense pain”, and one brilliant section features a whorl of multiple radio stations playing at once, to the most sweetly mind-bending, transportive effect, and of course, there’s that mad bit in the chicken coop, with splutters of laughter swept up with clucks and crowing cockerels and almost demonic, down pitched voices. It’s surely fair to say after a few listens thru that ‘Mirror’ expresses the artist’s individuality in a charmingly effortless style which epitomises the fact that everyone thinks and feels in different ways, yet it takes a special something to genuinely reflect that uniqueness in any piece of art, music, literature, film etc. And that’s exactly what he does inside. RIYL Smegma, RIP Hayman, the obscurest outsider musics, and the jouous musical explorations of Harry Partch. less"

A number of delays have pushed the release date back, but that was to allow extra input from Leila and Current Value, who join an illustrious production cast including Mark Bell, Matthew Herbert, 16 Bit and El Guincho, plus a full 24-piece Icelandic choir.

She still sounds like nobody else in the world, and with the multi-dimensional scope of 'Biophilia' Björk continues to represent a questing sonic and artistic vision which many younger artists could well learn from.

The ensuing career and creative output of this ongoing home studio / bedroom band remains one of the most significant song based ‘outre’ catalogues ever produced in the United Kingdom. This comprehensive 2 LP (+7” for first 300 copies) set contains their first official LP (originally released on The Residents legendary Ralph records label) along with an extra album of different versions and extra tracks which reside here for the first time on vinyl. The duo Renaldo & The Loaf, originally Portsmouth based, now in Portsmouth and Mid-Wales, remain an enigma whilst amassing an enormous cult following worldwide. Their singular take on music encompasses wit, strange melodic construction and an off kilter sensibility which successfully rendered them engaging for each emerging generation. The ability of Renaldo & The Loaf to unnerve and entertain in equal measure is what binds these songs to a musical universe outside of all other forms that existed around the time of release. The Residents are obvious spiritual heirs. Songs For Swinging Larvae is a classic collection of confounding songs which lead the listener into a surreal world of twisted tunes and perverted pop. Songs from the Surgery is made up of improvisations, early/alternative versions of various Larvae tracks and unreleased pieces from the same period. The results leave one laughing through a thick veil of unease.

   "name": "Brilliantly relentless LinnDrum productions made as a sort of homage to Prince’s ‘Parade’ album; 40 minutes of virulent, Afro-Latin polyrhythms that sound something like Prince producing free jazz jungle with Jamal Moss and the Príncipe gang. Lisbon-based Bruno Silva enacts pure voodoo with extended, restless LinnDrum workouts that take Prince’s distinctive LM-1 signatures as a starting point for loose-limbed tribal jams that flow with the colour of the Brazilian carnival and the rhythmic psychedelia of hardcore jungle. The title ‘Parada’ cannily nods both to Prince’s ‘Parade’ album and the percussion of carnival parades, speaking to a plurality of polyrhythms in a tradition of fusion music that seeks to meld myriad forms of communal, ritualistic and ecstatic music - not a million miles from the bare carnival funk of ‘Parade’s’ ’New Position’. In six parts ranging from extended runs of drumkit-falling-down-stairs to nimble junglist mutations and rapid, darting concisions, Serpente spells out a heavily intoxicating and intuitive sort of rhythmic psychedelia that lives up to a broad palette of influences ranging from Haitian voodoo ceremonies and central African drum circles, through to the Sun Ra Arkestra and Alan Silva’s Celestial Communion Orchestra, via Keith Hudson’s dub transcendence, and the rude modernism of UK rave and virulent styles currently coming from Lisbon ghettos on the Príncipe label. In attempting to untie and unite these worldly references, an asymmetric percussive friction and hypnotically unresolved tension naturally emerges from Serpente’s flux of machine made patterns. It’s there in the restlessly gnashing, swingeing brilliance of ‘Nivel de Chama’ and the exceptional mix of detuned Linn drums and reticulated jungle breaks in ‘Trama’, while the B-side probes this idea in three subtly agitated, but more space-out ’Símbolo’ parts, and finally with a sublime tension between his twitchy percussive saccades and celestial synth pads in ‘Nivel de Cinza. ‘Parada’ is pure body music that acknowledges both physical and spiritual needs, requiring a dancing body in order to properly unlock its purple magick. less"

   "name": "A Björk album is always a major event in the musical calendar, particularly for any followers of experimental music - no other artist can be credited with introducing such an array of avant-garde elements and production techniques so directly into the mainstream. The same goes for personnel: in hand-picking collaborators from the underground's finest talents Björk has been responsible for drawing the pop chart-following public's attention to the work of Matmos, Zeena Parkins, LFO's Mark Bell and Opiate's Thomas Knak. That's quite some achievement in itself. Only last week she went and put free drumming icon Chris Corsano on Saturday Night Live. I mean, that's just crazy. Also assisting with Volta's percussive backbone are Lightning Bolt's Brian Chippendale and Konono No. 1 (surely Congo's answer to scrap metal merchants Einsturzende Neubauten). What of the album though? Well, after Medùlla's uncompromising interrogation of the timbral identity of the human body, Björk has returned to the kind of outward-looking fieriness of Homogenic. That said, the rickety Afro-shuffle of single 'Earth Intruders' recalls the organic rhythms of 'Human Behaviour', only to segue into the similarly excellent 'Wanderlust' via an incredibly naturalistic, melodic manipulation of foghorn sounds from docking ships. It sounds amazing - like something you'd find on a Touch compilation, but here it is on a Top 40-bound release. 'Wanderlust' introduces one of the album's key elements, the pervasive use of brass, as best put to use on the heart-melting 'Pneumonia', which frames Björk's voice in the pitter-pat of rainfall recordings and a haunting, impeccably phrased horn arrangement. 'I See Who You Are' is almost as good, featuring Min Xiao-Fen's pipa (a Chinese stringed instrument) accompanied by a sequence of subtle electronic bass tones. Of course, Björk 's voice is the star here, and by the song's conclusion she's multitracked herself into quiet choral bliss. It's astonishingly beautiful. 'Innocence' is as playful as Björk's sounded for a while, its stop-start beat assisted by some circuit-frazzled synth work, and penultimate track 'Declare Independence' takes this idea even further, cranking the distortion to Alec Empire levels of Digital Hardcore punk electronics. The final track, 'My Juvenile' is graced with both Tounami Diabatè's virtuoso kora and Antony Hegarty's angelic vocal stylings (this is the second of two tracks to feature Antony) but as with the rest of Volta, this is all very much Björk's show, regardless of how impressive her list of collaborators may be. Stunning, absolutely essential listening from a truly great artist of our time. less"

   "name": "It's been three years since Bjork's last album landed on this planet but it seems just like yesterday. Such was and is the power of that album to remain in your subconscious, days, months, years after you first heard it. Going through another baffling pre-recording arrangement of ideas Bjork finally hit upon making 'Medúlla' (translated as marrow in latin) an album mostly stripped bare of acoustic and electronic instrumentation. Instead all the music had to come from the human voice (but not in a Bobby McFerrin way :), with this in mind she hooked up with Mike Patton, Rahzel, Robert Wyatt, Kelis, plus other lesser known artists and choirs from the UK and Iceland. Where music does creep in it's handled by Olivier Alary from Ensemble, Mark Bell, Matmos, Mark 'Spike' Stent (basically Bjork's backroom boys). Track highlights include the glacially electronic shimmer of 'Where Is The Line', 'Triumph Of A Heart' goes back to the 'Big Time Sensuality' vibe connected with 'Debut', with a dope human trombone accompaniment and dual beatbox attack. 'Mouth's Cradle' is about the wonder of breast feeding, an amazing cross pollination of choral voices, rapid tone chord changes and Bjork's voice driven by a kaos pad while a low riding human beatbox from Rahzel bumps this track along. 'Who Is It' is the poppiest track on this album and an absolute blast with Rahzel on amazing multi layered single take beatboxing form. 'Piano II' ventures into what Bjork calls emotional throat singing, wild sounds emit from the mysterious artist Tagaq who features on other tracks in a less confrontational manner - wild. My personal favourite is 'Submarine', a divine collaboration with the godlike Robert Wyatt, beautiful and beyond compare - mysterious and haunting, a musical equivalent of a foggy night by the docks watching the ships slowing swaying side to side. Bjork imparted to the Mixing It crew that this album was in part inspired by 911 and the experience of the birth of her second child Isadora. Maybe 'Medúlla' is not as instantly mind blowing as 'Vespertine' but with a few plays it'll lodge itself in your soul for months to come. Very essential. less"

In five movements Delia divvies the narrations into commonly recurring themes of ‘Running, ‘Land’, ‘Falling’, ‘Colour’, and ‘Sea’, which should all ring a bell with quite literally anyone who has fallen asleep and wondered what the fuck just happened there (provided you don’t smoke enough weed that you forget dreams instantly after waking, and live in a half-world of half-remembered recollections, that is). Even despite the fact all the voices are super plummy and Estuarial English, it’s probably fair to say we’ve all experienced those sensations at some point or another during our oneiric blips (hands-up for recurring dreams of wind tunnel drag and chromatic lushness), and this is one of those rare records that arguably speaks to each and every one of us, in its deeply unheimlich way.

It takes the form of a radio play about the life of French pilot and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, based on the 1956 book by Luc Estang. The vocals are performed by a small theatre troupe including French actor Paul Meurisse (1912-1979). Across the LP, Henry underlines critical points of the text with extra-dimensional sound, in the process reminding of everything from Arthur Lipsett’s ‘Soundtracks’ to the oneiric appeal of Delia Derbyshire’s ‘The Dreams’ LP (coincidentally also reissued by Fantôme Phonographique) and Luc Ferrari’s sound poetry. It’s a sterling example of a style and format that’s been largely lost with the passing of time. less"

Following the “traditional” arc of electroacoustic composition (listen—record—compose—deploy—feel), each of the contributions collected together here focuses in on a personal aspect, a fragment of that thrilling territory that is sonic and musical experimentation. Although the term “experimental music” may now have be understood as referring to a genre, or even a particular style, we ought to hold on to the original use of this term, which was based more on an approach than on any particular aesthetic line to be followed. The experimental is first and foremost a spirit, the spirit of the exploration of unknown territories, a spirit of invention which sees musical composition more as a voyage into uncertain territories than as a self-assured approach working safe within the bosom of fully mapped out and recognized lands.

   "name": "Classic, chimeric ‘70s meld of traditional Greek music and jazz-fusion from Kyriakos Sfetsas and his Greek Fusion Orchestra “TERANGA BEAT proudly presents Vol.2 of Kyriakos Sfetsas' 1976 \"Greek Fusion Orchestra\" project. Sfetsas' vision behind the formation of GFO, was to create a piece of work that would expand the boundaries of Greek traditional music. The result was a Progressive-Jazz Fusion masterpiece comprising complex and intriguing compositions, performed by Athens' best musicians of the day. Following the success of Vol.1, Vol.2 is a compilation of musical pieces Sfetsas recorded with the group right upon the completion of the Vol. 1 material. Vol.2 is still reflective of his ambition of bringing together progressive jazz and traditional music, but it does so in a different manner. Although the element of traditional music remains present, it does not provide the compositional foundation for the songs (e.g. most pieces are no longer based exclusively on traditional musical forms). More jazzy and more complex than Vol.1, Vol.2 has a darker feeling, presenting Sfetsas not only as a musical experimentalist, but also as a demanding and distinctive composer, who truly puts his musicians through the test. The recordings on this album are previously unreleased and form only a small part of his overall body of work with the GFO. The music was originally recorded Stereo on Reel Tape with highest standards for the time, with the modern mastering process highlighting even more their original sound quality. The result is a truly impressive and pure audiophile album, even slightly better than Vol.1 on that regard.” less"

   "name": "Following the reissue of Ziad Rahbani's \"Abu Ali\" album, Wewantsounds continues its exploration of great Lebanese music with the reissue of \"Wahdon,\" released in 1978 by legendary Middle Eastern diva Fairuz and recorded during the Abu Ali sessions and including the Lebanese dancefloor cult classic “Al Bostah“. \"1978 is a turning point for the Lebanese Diva. The 70s had seen her rise as an international star, playing sold out concerts in the US and in Europe, and appearing on national TV in France. She had had a long-lasting artistic collaboration with her husband Assi Rahbani and his brother Elias (aka The Rahbani Brothers) who, together, had penned most of the singer's classics. In 1978, Assi who had suffered a brain haemorrhage in 1972 got weaker and the collaboration finally ended (together with their personal relationship). Their 22 year old son Ziad took over Fairuz's musical reins and set to work on their first album together, \"Wahdon\" (\"Alone\"), serving as her mother's producer, composer and musical director. Wahdon typifies this key moment in Fairuz's career when she switched from traditional to more modern arrangements. The first side of the album encapsulates the more traditional side of the singer with such mesmerising songs as \"Habaitak Ta Neseet Al Naoum\" (\"I loved you so much i forgot to sleep\") or \"Ana Indi Haneen\" (\"I'm Nostalgic\"), filled with gorgeous arabic strings and percussion. The Second side though is a whole different affair. Recorded in Athens at the EMI Greece studio at the same time as the Abu Ali sessions, the two long tracks brings a hipper, contemporary funk and disco feel that has made the album such a collector's item with DJs and diggers around the world. Clocking at almost nine minutes \"Al Bostah\" (\"The Bus\") tells the story a woman in love remembering a bus journey with her lover under a scorching heat, enhanced by an hypnotic uptempo funkified disco beat, while \"Wahdon\" brings a slower and jazzier underlay to Fairuz's superb singing. These tracks shocked some of the diva's fans at the time but they've since passed the test of time and have become highly sought after. Whadon has since become both a classic Fairuz album and a cult Ziad Rahbani production that Wewantsounds is delighted to bring to a wider audience for the first time. less"

As with their two handfuls of material for Aught, their follow-up explores devilish permutations of rhythm and texture with a strong taste for variegated repetition and noisy - but not distorted - tones, with results that echo Hamburg’s enigmatic Werkbund crew as much as aspects of Sote or Hecker & Haswell’s music. In each of the 5 parts the artist gives voice to their machines in the uncanniest ways. The A-side opens with what sounds like a ELpH that crawled out of Coil’s studio to warn of future catastrophe, if only we could fully comprehend its fractal garble, while the proceeding two parts commit to pulsating, keening techno minimalism, and deviant, asymmetric automations that open out with a darkly melodic cadence on the B-side, before ultimately arriving at a freefall of piquant, shatterproof arps with discreet modulations sustaining the suspense to weightless, static, yet urgent effect. less"

His memory dragged around a lot of catchy refrains by Rabah Driassa and Abderrahmane Aziz, also natives of Blida, or by 'asri (modern music) masters Bentir or Lamari. He began his singing career in those years, chosing bedoui as a style. In June 1965, Algeria adopted a Soviet-style profile where everything was planned, even music. Mazouni, he followed his path, recording a few popular tunes, but he also was in the mood for traveling beyond the Mediterranean. During the 1950s and 1960s, Mohamed was dumbfounded by Oum Kalsoum's songs and scopitones. Fully immersed, he soaked up the songs of Dahmane El Harrachi, Slimane Azem, Akli Yahiaten, or Cheikh El Hasnaoui, but also those from the crazy years of twist and rock n' roll as embodied by Johnny Hallyday, Les Chaussettes Noires, or Les Chats Sauvages, not to mention Elvis Presley. Between 1970 and 1990, he had a series of hits. Mazouni, a dandy shattered by his century and always all spruced up who barely performed on stage, had greatly benefited from the impact of scopitones, the ancestors of music videos. His strength lay in Arabic lyrics all his compatriots could understand, and catchy melodies accompanied by violin, goblet drum, qanun, tar (a small tambourine with jingles), lute, and sometimes electric guitar on yé-yé compositions. Like a politician, Mazouni drew on all themes knowing that he would nail it each time. This earned him the nickname \"Polaroid singer\". Mohamed Mazouni crossed the 1960s and 1970s with his dark humor and unifying mix of local styles. Besides his trivial topics, he also denounced racism and the appalling condition of immigrant workers. However, his way of telling of high school girls, cars and pleasure places earned him the favors of France's young migrant zazous. At the end of the 1990s, the distribution of Michèle Collery and Anaïs Prosaïc's documentary on Arabic and Berber scopitones highlighted Mazouni's importance. Mazouni did not stop singing and even had a few local hits, always driven by a \"wide targeting\" ambition.” less"

   "name": "Available on vinyl for the first time in 40 years, Outernational Sounds proudly presents a crucial document from the Los Angeles jazz underground - the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra at their most together, stretching out on home turf in 1979, with the legendary Horace Tapscott at the helm. \"Horace Tapscott is one of the unsung giants of jazz music. A gifted composer and arranger, a boldly original pianist, and above all a visionary bandleader, Tapscott’s recorded footprint is small, but his legacy continues to vibrate through the Los Angeles music underground. From Freestyle Fellowship to Build An Ark, Kamasi Washington and Dwight Trible, it all traces back to Tapscott. The pianist was an organiser, and instead of chasing a successful recording career, he wanted to build a community band that would act as ‘a cultural safe house for the music.’ ‘I wanted to say, “This is your music. This is black music, and I want to present a panorama of the whole thing right here”’ said Tapscott in the late 1990s. ‘We would preserve the music on our ark, the mothership…’ That mothership was the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra – the Ark. As a culturally radical, communal big band with a visionary approach to American Black music, Tapscott’s group is second only to the other famous Arkestra, that of Sun Ra. Tapscott had founded the group in 1961 as the Underground Musicians Association (UGMA). It changed its name to the Pan African Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and through the seventies the players lived, played and worked together. Community work and political consciousness were at the heart of the project, and for two decades they played in street, park and coffee house. With Tapscott as their guide and mentor, the Arkestra worked with theatre groups, poets and revolutionaries, ran music workshops and teaching sessions for children and adults, and played fundraisers, benefits and rallies for political and social causes both global and local. From 1973 to 1981 their main rehearsal and concert space was the Immanuel United Church of Christ (I.U.C.C.) on 85th St and Holmes Ave. The Arkestra played there every second Sunday, developing their sound and hipping new audiences to their vision. Live At I.U.C.C., recorded in early 1979, was the only live recording the band released. In full flow, and at the height iof their powers, the group recorded here features original 1961 UGMA members Linda Hill, David Bryant and Alan Hines, alongside the powerful voices of a new generation including Jesse Sharps, Sabir Mateen, and Adele Sebastian. Showcasing spiritualised classics from Arkestra’s songbook, including the heavy modal groovers ‘Desert Fairy Princess’ and ‘Macrame’, Live At I.U.C.C. is a rare chance to hear one of the most important, foundational bands in the music stretching out on their own thing. With the great Horace Tapscott at the piano, this is the rarely captured sound of the mothership in full flight!\" less"

   "name": "Martin Rev is best known as one half of the duo Suicide (with Alan Vega). Suicide mirrored the reductive and radical traits of the contemporaneous punk scene that was in the process of emerging, but their electronic, minimalist form of language was so unique, so innovative, that they would become a major influence on the likes of Daft Punk, Air and Aphex Twin. Alongside his work with Suicide, Martin Rev continued as a solo artist, releasing his eponymous debut album in 1980 on New York’s Infidelity label. Rev’s early solo excursions can be traced back to the original ideas which can be found – in modified form – in Suicide songs: as instrumental versions which have been texturally enriched, like a familiar figure which has nevertheless taken on a completely new existence. \"Although it was not released until 1991, Martin Rev’s third solo album features a wealth of material from the year 1980. For “Cheyenne”, Rev created instrumental versions of many of the tracks which had formed the basis of the second Suicide LP entitled “Alan Vega / Martin Rev”. The sphere of Martin Rev’s influence and the relevance of his music may well be related to the fact that he was one of the first artists who succeeded in grasping the abstraction of electronic music, infusing it with a sense of immediacy built on raw energy. Whilst the likes of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Kraftwerk were busy digging in the electronic music garden, Martin Rev found inspiration in the streets of New York. Rev’s music is informed by characteristic influences of the city, a place where doo-wop harmonies intermingle with the hiss and hum of the metropolis, dissolving into a collage of noise. So it is that dreamy, chiming melodies blur into ominous whirrs and drones emanating from rhythm machines and layers of distorted synthesizer. This polarity between convergence and alienation describes something deeply American, as reflected in the track names and the cover image of a rodeo rider: “The idea came from the way the tracks sounded as instrumentals. They took on a different visually descriptive dimension, even more so in combination. The visualization was an immediate sound- scape of the American landscape. That’s where the titles and cover came from.” Many of the pieces found on Cheyenne can be traced back to the sessions for the second Suicide album Alan Vega / Martin Rev (1980) which was produced by Ric Ocasek, singer for The Cars. Almost a decade passed before Martin Rev got around to editing and developing the material. “Most of the album was recorded in 1980, but the remaining few tracks from 1988 into the early 90’s. The 80’s tracks all went under a concerted editing process, to make them work for me even better as instrumentals. I didn’t get around to that until there was an offer to release them, which was in the early 90’s as well.” Indeed, Cheyenne plays out like a rural, yet intense road movie, crossing a landscape rich in beauty and contradictions.\" less"

   "name": "Indispensable issue of this hypnotising album showcasing the work of Umm Kulthum, the almost mythical “fourth pyramid” of Egypt, an artist so well known and revered throughout the middle east since the 1940’s that despite having died almost 50 years ago, she continues to resonate. With her distinctive contralto - the lowest register of the female voice - and aided by a virtuoso orchestra operating at the very fringes of classical, avant garde and popular music, Kulthum’s still sounds utterly unique and modern. If you’re new to her work - we urge you to dive in. With the help of maverick composer and oud player Mohammad El Qasabgi, Umm Kulthum’s orchestra was formed in the mid 1920’s and by the late 1930’s had become so popular that millions watched her appear in movies and broadcasts of concerts every week. Singing songs of love, loss and patriotism with words by poet Ahmad Rami, and fuelled by El Qasabgi’s modern and often highly unusual orchestration, Kulthum stitched Western influence to a tapestry of often fiercely traditional words and music, and a singing style that is often acknowledged as unparalleled. For a singer born at the very end of the 19th century, it’s remarkable that Kulthum’s legacy is still so dominant well into the 21st, with an iconic presence perhaps best illustrated by her appearance as a hologram in shows earlier this year. Although she's perhaps become less known outside the middle east in recent years, we've no doubt that even a short listen to these clips will pull you into the soundworld of one of the most unique, mesmerising voices of the 20th century - and not let go for a while. less"

Martin Rev remembers: “Clouds of Glory was produced from visual and musical sketches I had in mind which then coincidedwith an invitation by Marty Thau, previously Suicide’s manager, to take advantage of studio time he had accumulated from other projects. The essence of my ideas was then realized in the studio. Clouds was started in 1981 and completed in 1984 when additionalstudio time was made possible to complete it, based on the offer by New Rose Records.” In spite of Clouds Of Glory having been recorded with the sameequipment as the Alan Vega / Martin Rev Suicide album, it occupies a completely different space, evoking the solemnity of religious music through its underlying meditative tone. “I look now upon the album as part of a personal journey into the frontier of music; a process which is never ending in its revealing of possibilities to satisfy my musical aspirations.” less"

   "name": "Outernational Sounds presents a cornerstone document from the Los Angeles jazz underground, Flight 17 -- the first appearance on record of the legendary Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra, led by their founder and mastermind, Horace Tapscott. Available on vinyl for the first time in 40 years. \"The Arkestra would allow the creativity in the community to come together, would allow people to recognize each other as one people. Horace Tapscott's Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra (P.A.P.A.) was one of the most transformative, forward-thinking and straight-up heavy big bands to have played jazz in the 1960s and 1970s. If P.A.P.A. doesn't have the interstellar rep of that other famous Arkestra, and if the name Tapscott doesn't ring bells like Monk or Tyner, there's a reason why: in an industry dominated by record labels, a band that doesn't record doesn't count. And the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra didn't record for nearly twenty years. But recording success was never their concern -- they weren't about that. First formed as the Underground Musicians Association in the early 1960s, Tapscott always wanted his group to be a community project. From their base in Watts, UGMA got down at the grassroots. The group was renamed the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and soon after they established a monthly residency at the Immanuel United Church of Christ which ran for over a decade, while still playing all over LA and beyond. But they never released a note of music. It was the intervention of fan Tom Albach that finally got them on wax. Determined that their work should be documented, Albach founded Nimbus Records specifically to release the music of Tapscott, the Arkestra, and the individuals that comprised it. The first recording sessions in early 1978 yielded enough material for two albums, and the first release was Flight 17. From the surging avant-gardism of Herbie Baker's title track to the laidback summertime groove of Kamonta Lawrence Polk's \"Maui\", or Roberto Miranda's up-tempo Latin jam \"Horacio\", Flight 17 showcased the radical voices of the Arkestra's members. Led out by Tapscott's hard-swinging piano, this is the first flight on wax of the West Coasts' foundational community big band -- energized, hip, and together. Contains two tracks previously only available on the 1997 CD edition: \"Coltrane Medley\" and \"Village Dance\", recorded live at the Immanuel United Church of Christ.” less"

This bold new record mirrors decay of the physical world and the human form through its jarring sound palette and tense atmospheres. It’s a rebirth of sorts, with the title a reference to shedding skin — as KSP has done with his previous aliases. Combining his roots in jungle and dub (as Raiden and Dot Product) with the diverse textures of the contemporary techno diaspora and his skills as a found sound magpie and foley artist, it makes for a riveting, deeply nuanced listen. ‘Skin Cells’ begins with distorted synth buzzes trading places with haunted, heavily processed samples and thundering kicks. ‘Sparks’ channels taut jungle breakbeats, pitched down to a more chugging tempo, while menacing D&B screeches buzz through the track. ‘Dust’ teases DMZ style dubstep tension, while ‘Rain’ shows his mastery of sound design and field recording in a stunning ambient interlude. ‘Insomnia’ reaches for glitchy digi dub in the vein of The Bug with some cinematic undertones, leading to the brutalist sonic architecture of ‘Crumbs’ with its crunching breaks and rasping tones. ‘Derelict’ is the album’s most direct nod to his junglist past, the ghosts of hardcore imbued through blasts of chainsaw bass, dissected breaks and haunting pads. ‘Grey Clouds’ bathes you in thick swathes of ethereal pads and plucked, incessant bass before ‘EF5’ delivers a militant glitch-heavy onslaught. ‘An Empty Sky’ closes the album in apocalyptic fashion, with crunching bass pressure juxtaposed with graceful, filmic chord progressions. The result of all of this is an album that feels at once uniquely London while perfectly contemporary to the Berlin scene, and perhaps a none-more-perfect sonic encapsulation of the continuing reciprocal dialogue between the two cities. Most of all, it’s the sound of a sonic excavator hurtling towards the top of his game, in perfect control of every granule of sound therein.” less"

Stevie Moore, Leven Signs, Jung Analysts, and Rimarimba. Rimarimba was the project of Robert Cox, based in Felixstowe, on the seaside in Suffolk, UK. Rimarimba was not Cox’s first entry into the world of recorded music, but was the first time he explored, most perceptively, the parameters of a particular musical mode: one where minimalism is removed from its “highart” mantle, Cox inveigling its practices in amongst the do-it-yourself creativity of a burgeoning and beguiling underground, letting the music breathe – and most importantly, letting it play, gifting it with imagination. For Rimarimba’s 1984 album On Dry Land, Cox advances along the terrain explored on Below The Horizon. It’s an enchanting album, one which, at times, seems to comment on its own practice; a picture of everyday life in the hobbyist’s, or part-time musician’s, recording studio. Some moments point towards the tourist-explorer aesthetic that would eventually coalesce under the banner of Fourth World music. Other moments where Cox seems to be channelling an otherness, a kind of hauntological reverie, the feeling of music that gives us an uncanny sense of déjà vu. Writer David Keenan’s description of Japanese naïve-pop group Maher Shalal Hash Baz’s music, that it “feels like sketches of places where we once were, places now made poignant by our absence” feels like an alternate take On Dry Land. On March 1st, 2019, Freedom To Spend will offer In The Woods in a one-time edition of 750 copies.

No overdubs or editing took place, just the sound that filled the room as the jams emerged. The results are two extended, hypnotic synth odysseys that unfurl organically as their melodic layers reveal themselves over time. Side A 'Locked In' opens with tranquil, sparkling synth chimes that give way to a pulsating (but largely beatless) Krautrock-meets-dub groove, anchored by an insistent bassline and interlocking layers of synth lines that unfurl over its 15 minutes.

   "name": "Originally released in November 1981 on Les Disques du Crepuscule, Hommages was recorded in Leicester in February 1981 and produced by noted Belgian new music composer Wim Mertens. The album was conceived as a series of diverse homages to other composers, which include Bill Evans (My First Homage), Ferruccio Busoni and Gustav Holst (The English Mail-Coach and The Vespertine Park) and Percy Grainger (Hi-Tremolo). The earliest of the pieces here (appropriately titled 'My First Homage') was penned in 1978 for a performance at The Kitchen in New York as a tribute to the work of jazz pianist Bill Evans, and features some beautiful harmonic exchanges across its captivating quarter-hour duration. Both 'The English Mail-Coach' and the quite stunningly beautiful piano and percussion of 'The Vespertine Park' were inspired by Ferruccio Busoni, and you can hear a certain neo-classical approach in these works, although they remain firmly rooted in the 20th century. Significantly, this remastered edition of the album includes two bonus recordings: 'Out Of Zalieski's Gazebo' and 'Danse Dieppoise', both compositions drawn from the same period of Bryars' work. less"

If you're into any of the above, this one will push all your buttons at once. With each new album Irisarri has managed to tweak and fine-tune his production to the point where 'Solastalgia' finds his now perfected swells soar to new heights. Although it’s a sound that's been tried and tested numerous times over the last couple of decades, and by many artists, Irisarri here manages to assemble perhaps the definitive article for this kind of quietly epic late night melodrama; where liminal dream states nod to classic Shoegaze, while submerged, shimmering melodies remind us of both Talk Talk ('Kiss All The Pretty Skies Goodbye’) and Fennesz (Coastal Trapped Disturbance). The album is essentially about the sense of sorrow and despair at the environmental and socioeconomic disaster we all face, but ‘Solastalgia’ is ultimately a deeply personal listen, one that attempts to slow down time so that we might savour the beauty around us, if even for just an hour. less"

Badge employs an eclectic cast of characters from the Toronto underground music scene, whose combined experience would take pages to spell out. It includes stints accompanying songwriters Andy Shauf and Marker Starling, outfitting heavies Blood Ceremony and Biblical, and respective careers spent gigging Django-jazz and the classical cannon. Badge’s distinctive sound arises from the diversity of these musical exploits, creating a palpable chemistry well captured on the live-tracked songs that form the group’s self-titled debut. The record is a collection of densely packed grooves, arranged by committee. Dank set pieces culminate in album standout, ‘Undressed In Solitude’, which features the otherworldly r ’n b of guest vocalist, James Baley. Over 11 simmering minutes, the track defies the contemporary fixations of automated music to convincingly combine sensual and cerebral textures. While it may call to mind an improbable collision between psych-era Stevie Wonder and the whimsically dark, Fantastic Planet score, it is clear we are operating in a post Wu-Tang paradigm. The blocky beats and bit-crushed landscapes of the record at large make for tactile productions (courtesy of a collaboration among producers Steve Chahley, Tony Price and Twig) that can’t be comfortably ascribed to any one particular era of music making. If a crate of library, tropicalia, prog and electric jazz records were flattened into a single 12” and then fed into a sampler, we might approximate the process. Instrumental hip hop by reverse osmosis, a musical perspective where Madlib’s jazz excursions carry as much weight as his sample-laced productions.” less"

Now based in Paris, Sara Bigdeli Shamloo and Nima Aghiani are expanding their stylistic scope and team up with long-time friend Siavash Amini for their debut release on Hallow Ground. After 2017’s »TAR« and »FORAS« the year after 2018, »Harmistice« is Amini’s third LP for Hallow Ground and his first in collaboration with other artists. Recorded in Paris and Tehran, the four tracks are the result of »all the long hours of speaking online, being kilometres away, it is a love child of those short times we actually got to be physically in one place.« Vocalist and lyricist Shamloo enters a dialogue with Aghiani and Amini’s sound art, which is from restrained but interlocks voice and noise with striking subtlety. »Harmistice« seamlessly blends the visceral with the sublime, the abstract with the oh-too-real. From the very first second of »Blue as in Bleeding«, »Harmistice« evokes a sense of suspended terror. Shrill frequencies and aleatoric bursts of feedback give way to a hard-hitting bass drum until Shamloo’s voice arises from the chaos with an uneasy clarity. It’s the perfect opening for a record that is built upon stark contrasts like this one. Amini and Aghiani bring together synthetic sounds with acoustic instruments, creating a tangible tension on which Shamloo’s sometimes sensitive, sometimes emotionally detached delivery thrives. »It’s all based on a dream, a nightmare about war,« she says in regards to her lyrics that move between poetic abstraction and first person prose, blurring the lines between lived experience and sinister premonition. »Harmistice« takes inventory after the oneiric damagehas been dealt in real life. As a whole, »Harmistice« is thus as ambiguous as its title suggests. As an all-too-lucid dream about unspeakable things that are being lent a voice it overwhelms the senses with an unheard-of volume. Drawn from the depths of the subconscious, »Harmistice« may just be the most challenging album in either 9T Antiope or Amini’s discography.” less"

   "name": "Total pearl from the enigmatic Altkat, apparently a 70-odd year old Turkish-Armenian who has been recording since the 1960’s with an Anatolian saz, a two track tape recorder, and a fluegelhorn. Naturally we’re getting strong Abul Mogard / Jürgen Müller sonic fiction vibes from this one, but, nonetheless, 'Lakerda' is a' highly satisfying listen somewhere between Burnt Friedman, Jon Hassell and the pan pipe CD selection at Shared Earth in 1996. That’s a complement btw. \"Today, the saz is still there, the bugle is gone and the tape recorder has turned into a computer. Altkat, who spends most of his time working as a percussionist for sephardic and balkanic bands, is above all interested in the transformation of noise into music and does not shy away from using synthesizers and drum machines, along with his saz, to create his music. Lakerda exists somewhere beyond the “traditional” and “non traditional” realms. It is marked by hybridity and the encounter of seemingly opposite notions, such as tradition and modernity, East and West, past and future, but also acoustic and electronic and more abstractly, here and there. This album takes the listener beyond these oppositions and invites him or her to approach Altkat’s music not on ultimately fallacious “either/or” terms, but simply to receive it as it is, a fourth world record, with each track on the album a palimpsest that encapsulates previously mentioned oppositions and transcends them in the process. Full of morphing textures, metallic resonance, layered arrangements, plucked saz strings, pitch-sliding winds, shimmering melodies, bleeps and blops, peculiar samples and other disorienting sounds, this album seems indebted to the aesthetics of private press albums from the late 20th century. While some of these have recently been reissued by labels such as Music From Memory, Into The Light and Stroom to name but a few, Lakerda also feels more contemporary, and it is certainly not out of place in Banlieue’s catalogue.\" less"

   "name": "One of the year's most satisfying 12\"s, featuring two killer, extended remixes of Equiknoxx by Mark Ernestus, containing perhaps the most Basic Channel-esque production from Ernestus in a decade. Mark Ernestus dubs Equiknoxx to the moon and back for DDS with an irresistibly percolated take on Congo Get Slap backed with a jaw-dropping, Basic Channel style version of Flagged Up. We hardly need to stress that this one’s a doozy. As a big fan of Equiknoxx’s teched-out take on up-to-the-second dancehall, it was perhaps inevitable that the venerable Ernestus, owner of Berlin’s Hardwax and one half of the legendary Basic Channel and Rhythm & Sound, as well as his most recent work with the brilliant Ndagga Rhythm Force, would eventually cross paths with Jamaica’s Gavsborg and Time Cow, two of the most exciting producers to emerge from JA this decade. On both remixes the past informs the present in timeless fashion. The cloud-bursting chords and spaghetti western-esque tropes of Equiknoxx’s Congo Get Slap are deftly diffused in the echo chamber, giving the bass an elasticated recoil and sublimating the chords to scudding, skywards dabs with weightless effect for the dancers. Flipside, Ernestus takes that aspect one step further, distilling the kinetic dub futurism of Someone Flagged It Up!! into a maze of diaphanous dub chords and rolling, sunken subs that inarguably measures up among his strongest post-Basic Channel works. Like Shackleton’s dub of The Stopper by Cutty Ranks for DDS, the results here triangulate deep-rooted connections between Jamaica, Lancashire and Berlin, speaking to a mutual respect and reverence of style and pattern which has heavily resonated from sub-tropical Kingston into much colder, European climes over successive generations. less"

Cage relates several anecdotes about Wolff in his one-minute Indeterminacy pieces. These two discs reveal Wolff as a composer fully exploring, in different ways, the continuum between music which is highly fragmented, embracing extended silences [composed or indeterminate], to that which is more progressive and seemingly driven, albeit taking in disarming and unconventional routes. \"As a body of repertoire, these works are remarkable for their freshness of musical thought and energy (John Cage considered Wolff to be the most 'musical' of the experimental composers). In all my performances of Wolff's music i aim for interpretations that both interest and surprise me, allowing the notations to lead me to new ways of playing and thinking about music, whilst at the same time trying to lead the notations toward the unexpected...\" Philip Thomas less"

   "name": "Delia Beatriz aka Debit gets down to rugged fundamentals on ‘System’, the bruising follow-up to her flashier ‘Animus’ album. Asymmetric, astringent, aggy, ‘System’ finds Debit’s sound delacquered of gloss and delivered in gruff, textured tones in a wicked balance of gripping rhythmic sensuality and brutality, including a collaboration with footwork producer DJ Earl that stands up firmly next Jlin’s percussive ingenuity. There’s barely any conventional melody throughout the album, but anyone with an ounce of bounce in their gruds will surely find lines to follow in the rhythmelodic cadence of Debit’s drum programming, where, in the classic style of computer-arranged reggaeton, she accentuates multiple snares and variants of other percussion that unfurl in reticulated tresillo rhythms. In experimenting with these patterns, she often pushes her drums into pure, gravelly distortion, pointing to an effect that’s both atavistic and futurist between the primal growl and cold knocks of ‘The Alphabet’ featuring Javier Estrada and the outstanding churn of her ‘Numbering’ hook-up with DJ Earl, while giving up deadly strong highlights in the Slikback-compatible pressure of ‘My House’, and her knot of clenched rave stabs and sloshing groove in ‘Medicine.’ Highly Recommended! less"

   "name": "The first authorised reissue of this hugely sought-after 1976 album of moog music for plants... \"Hearing Plantasia in the 21st century, it seems less an ode to our photosynthesizing friends by Garson and more an homage to his wife, the one with the green thumb that made everything flower around him. In the mid-1970s, a force of nature swept across the continental United States, cutting across all strata of race and class, rooting in our minds, our homes, our culture. It wasn’t The Exorcist, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, or even bell-bottoms, but instead a book called The Secret Life of Plants. The work of occultist/former OSS agent Peter Tompkins and former CIA agent/dowsing enthusiast Christopher Bird, the books shot up the bestseller charts and spread like kudzu across the landscape, becoming a phenomenon. Seemingly overnight, the indoor plant business was in full bloom and photosynthetic eukaryotes of every genus were hanging off walls, lording over bookshelves, and basking on sunny window ledges. The science behind Secret Life was specious: plants can hear our prayers, they’re lie detectors, they’re telepathic, able to predict natural disasters and receive signals from distant galaxies. But that didn’t stop millions from buying and nurturing their new plants. Perhaps the craziest claim of the book was that plants also dug music. And whether you purchased a snake plant, asparagus fern, peace lily, or what have you from Mother Earth on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles (or bought a Simmons mattress from Sears), you also took home Plantasia, an album recorded especially for them. Subtitled “warm earth music for plants…and the people that love them,” it was full of bucolic, charming, stoner-friendly, decidedly unscientific tunes enacted on the new-fangled device called the Moog. Plants date back from the dawn of time, but apparently they loved the Moog, never mind that the synthesizer had been on the market for just a few years. Most of all, the plants loved the ditties made by composer Mort Garson. Few characters in early electronic music can be both fearless pioneers and cheesy trend-chasers, but Garson embraced both extremes, and has been unheralded as a result. When one writer rhetorically asked: “How was Garson’s music so ubiquitous while the man remained so under the radar?” the answer was simple. Well before Brian Eno did it, Garson was making discreet music, both the man and his music as inconspicuous as a Chlorophytum comosum. Julliard-educated and active as a session player in the post-war era, Garson wrote lounge hits, scored plush arrangements for Doris Day, and garlanded weeping countrypolitan strings around Glen Campbell’s “By the Time I Get to Phoenix.” He could render the Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel alike into easy listening and also dreamed up his own ditties. “An idear” as Garson himself would drawl it out. “I live with it, I walk it, I sing it.” But as his daughter Day Darmet recalls: “When my dad found the synthesizer, he realized he didn’t want to do pop music anymore.” Garson encountered Robert Moog and his new device at the Audio Engineering Society’s West Coast convention in 1967 and immediately began tinkering with the device. With the Moog, those idears could be transformed. “He constantly had a song he was humming,” Darmet says. “At the table he was constantly tapping.” Which is to say that Mort pulled his melodies out of thin air, just like any household plant would. The Plantae kingdom grew to its height by 1976, from DC Comics’ mossy superhero Swamp Thing to Stevie Wonder’s own herbal meditation, Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. Nefarious manifestations of human-plant interaction also abounded, be it the grotesque pods in Invasion of the Body Snatchers or the pothead paranoia of the US Government spraying Mexican marijuana fields with the herbicide paraquat (which led to the rise in homegrown pot by the 1980s). And then there’s the warm, leafy embrace of Plantasia itself. “My mom had a lot of plants,” Darmet says. “She didn’t believe in organized religion, she believed the earth was the best thing in the whole world. Whatever created us was incredible.” And she also knew when her husband had a good song, shouting from another room when she heard him humming a good idear. Novel as it might seem, Plantasia is simply full of good tunes. Garson may have given the album away to new plant and bed owners, but a decade later a new generation could hear his music in another surreptitious way. Millions of kids bought The Legend of Zelda for their Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1986 and one distinct 8-bit tune bears more than a passing resemblance to album highlight “Concerto for Philodendron and Pothos.” Garson was never properly credited for it, but he nevertheless subliminally slipped into a new generations’ head, helping kids and plants alike grow. Hearing Plantasia in the 21st century, it seems less an ode to our photosynthesizing friends by Garson and more an homage to his wife, the one with the green thumb that made everything flower around him. “My dad would be totally pleased to know that people are really interested in this music that had no popularity at the time,” Darmet says of Plantasia’s new renaissance. “He would be fascinated by the fact that people are finally understanding and appreciating this part of his musical career that he got no admiration for back then.” Garson seems to be everywhere again, even if he’s not really noticed, just like a houseplant.\" less"

   "name": "Suzanne Ciani sets text by Baudelaire to wondrous Buchla synth tones in 1969’s ‘Flowers of Evil.’ Better yet are her three studies in shatterproof rhythms and spooky abstract electronics, ‘Glass Houses’ and ‘Token Spokes’. All newly excavated and issued by Finders Keepers “As a genuine vanguard of electronic music composition at the forefront of the modular synthesiser revolution in the late 1960s, Suzanne Ciani’s forward-thinking approach to new music would rarely look to the past for inspiration, which makes this unheard composition from 1969 a rare exception to the collective futurist vision of Ciani and synthesiser designer Don Buchla. In choosing to adapt the controversial prose of French poet Charles Baudelaire, Suzanne would join the ranks of ongoing generations of pioneering musicians like Olivier Messiaen, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Serge Gainsbourg, Etron Fou Leloublan, Celtic Frost and Marc Almond (not forgetting Star Trek’s William Shatner!), all equally inspired by the 19th century writer’s works of “modernité” (modernity), a self-coined term dedicated to capturing the eeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, best exempli ed in his symbolic, erotic and macabre ode to Parisian industrialisation, Les Fleurs du mal (Flowers Of Evil). In her varied career that would combine art gallery installations, major lm soundtrackings and commissions for Atari, Suzanne Ciani’s earliest experiments remain some of her most challenging, beguiling and timeless... Flowers Of Evil ticks all the above boxes and icks switches that would power-up a new uncharted universe of her own musical modernité. For the many enthusiasts that have already drawn the parallels between Baudelaire’s writings and experimental/ electronic music (a relationship rivalled only by the likes of J. G. Ballard and Aldous Huxley) some might instantly recognise an unconscious sistership between this recording and another 1969 electronic adaptation of Flowers Of Evil by celebrated female electronic composer Ruth White. An interesting distinction of White’s excellent version of Flowers Of Evil (released via Limelight records, home to the likes of Fifty Foot Hose and Paul Bley) is that its dark tone generation and vocal manipulation was created with a Moog synthesiser, the commercially triumphant rival to Suzanne and Don’s Buchla Systems (Buchla and Moog’s historic, simultaneous, neck-and-neck synth developments are well documented.) The fact that Ciani’s version was never intended for commercial release (not unlike her 1975 Buchla concerts, which could easily have taken Morton Subotnick’s Bull by the horns!) is also poetically re ective of the nature of Ciani and Buchla’s alternative perspective. The choice to present this extract from Flowers Of Evil in its intended French language further distances Ciani’s faithful reaction from some of its better-known variations. Having attempted to voice the poem herself, the multilingual Italian-American composer’s French accent did not meet her own standards, resulting in the request for a fellow unnamed French student who lived on campus at Mills College in Oakland to accurately verbalise the section of Baudelaire’s collection entitled Élévation.” less"

Heavy support from Ossia, Ron Morelli & Demdike Stare, highly recommended to anyone on that noisy/wave tip. T was the brainchild of Caballero T, a key figure in Spain’s underground/industrial scene, enlisting the the studio wizardry of Señor Nada and the vocals of Tres, whose psychotic vocals imbue proceedings with a demented, post-punk asymmetry. Although spread through 14 individual tracks, 'Dark Fields’ was recorded in one continuous session in 1982 and unfurls from tripped out synth motifs to full-on industrial attacks and skewed wavy numbers that recall everything from Brian Eno’s early solo output to Joy Division, Suicide and into more abstracted, noisy territory and drum machine experiments somewhere in the region of Muslimgauze’s early work as E.g Oblique Graph and John Bender’s material from the same period. T disbanded soon after 'Dark Fields' was recorded, leaving this LP as the sole document of their work. Reissued by Equilibrio, the same label that gave us that brilliant Randomize album '¿Cómo Se Divertirán Los Insectos?’, it’s an intriguing look at the Spanish underground scene that’s still a bit of a blindspot for us, and is a unique artefact from an era that has already been completely over-mined, but which still, occasionally, throws out pearls like this one.

The first half is concerned with exquisitely tender and melodic motifs in a 4th World Japanese style, pull of gently pitch bent tones, rippling flute and glowing percussive harmonies that arrive at lovely junctures of jazz-fusion and Japanese minimalism in ‘Teccmonc’ and endlessly reverberant choral composition in ‘Bendires Trasher’. However, the 2nd half gradually grows denser with the transition from spiritual jazz gestures to rushing tribal tresillo rhythms n ‘Endocrync (Museo De La Revolution)’, and that percussive itch spills out in more unpredictable, almost theatrical/operatic ways in ‘High Light’, to resolve in the refined ambient inceptions of ‘Aoesdawas’. less"

   "name": "Burial’s eponymous debut LP is a defining beacon of post-millenium dance and electronic music. Written between 2001-2006, the follow-up to his debut 12” South London Boroughs, further consolidated what were previously mutually exclusive strains of music with unprecedented guile, vision and emotive impact, done to mind-blowing and award-winning effect. In 2016 it’s easy for folk to forget that prior to this album, aside from a select handful of producers such as Horsepower Productions, El-B or Kode 9, effectively nobody was writing tracks circa 138bpm and using this kind of palette of samples, textures and spaces to the same ends as Will Bevan, a.k.a. Burial. And still, even fewer of them were writing without the dancefloor or radio squarely in mind. Enter Burial, whose impressionistic, unquantized soundscapes reset the neuroses of Teebee and Bad Company’s neo-D&B with a romance and swing better associated with Steve Gurley and El-B, whilst also listening to and channelling the atmosphere of his environment in a way better likened to the spaces explored by Basic Channel and Rhythm & Sound, but animated like a Massive Attack album produced and collaged by Chris Watson; albeit a Watson raised in suburban British sprawl and smoky bedrooms playing tense computer games and watching classic anime and thrillers on VHS, or whatever obscure foreign flicks Channel 4 had on late at night. Honestly, nowadays that period seems eons away - especially in light of streaming services where you can find thee most obscure art at the touch of keyboard - but back on original release, this record nailed an atmosphere, even a lifestyle, that was lived by many souls on the peripheries who couldn’t be arsed with the menu offered by provincial high street clubs or cable TV, or a culture artificially inflated by major labels and the media. It almost feels daft and futile trying to explain this to anyone under the age of 30 - or those cold hearted cynics who roll their eyes at the mere mention of his name - but, quite honestly Burial’s music nailed the vibe so heavily that it felt like déjà vu, uncannily weaving together the disparate strands of culture that meant so much to the artist, and by turns, us the listeners. There are still tonnes of naysayers, but fuck ‘em - Burial’s music is hugely danceable and mixable by the right DJs, but there’s no denying that it probably sounds best in bedrooms or headphones where you can give it your full attention, or vice versa. Despite the temporal dislocation, the 2007 smoking ban, and the sign-posted, rictus rigidity of too much modern dance music, we’d still love to think there’s a whole new generation out there who will get and love this record as hard as we did, and do. less"

Incorporating the vital, free-roaming percussive suss of Valentina, who props up what is perhaps one of the rhythmic achilles heel of Helm’s music, World In Action makes a nod to the ‘80s/‘90s current affairs TV programme of the same title in its sleeve artwork and centre labels depicting their ident, Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, perhaps amounting a sort of hauntological elegy for the British popular intellect and sense of proportionality. An impressionistic distillation of the times, on World In Action Younger layers and interrogates a number of studio and field recordings made in East London, South-East Kent and at Snaresbrook Crown Court to form his own personal echo chamber of claggy clangour and worried sax scrabble, oscillating between impenetrable skronk and wistful spiritual jazz motifs in the opening Blue Scene, to dwell on a push-and-pull of vintage 8-bit sonics and deconstructed techno with Candy, whereas World In Action itself is a determined trudge through barbed and murderously noxious levels of polluted atmospheres, then effectively ripping the rug from under your feet and pirouetting in freefall with After Dark. less"

Taking its title from Norway’s 2nd largest island, where it was conceived, the album features outdoor sounds and improvisations made during Jenssen’s stays between 2015-2018 and finds the artist more porous than ever to distorted, granular textures along with his trademark palette of elemental electronics. It’s essentially the artist getting closer than ever to his surroundings and cutting down the space between there and your ears. From the sounds of it, one can only imagine Jenssen had a quietly blissful time making this record. There’s the expected darkness for sure, but it always resolves with strong pangs of isolationist melody, cropping up Conet Project-like in ’Strandby’; glowing like a dawn aurora behind a granite cliff in ‘Berg’; or harmonising with the birds and air in ‘Fjølhøgget’ and the Aeolian harp-like tones of his ‘Bergsbotn’ trio, so named after the small village facing out to harsh North Atlantic. factor in the natural yet unearthly sounds picked up by his hydrophone in ’Skålbrekka’, and the gloaming solitude of his sublime closer ‘Hå’, and you have a top class Biosphere album, if you like this sort of thing. less"

He has made an album that is filled with joy and sunshine, saturated with the classic feel of Berlin Techno. Tom Scholefield has moved on from the dark ambient and brittle rave of the first two Konx-om-Pax albums, which were a reflection of his hometown Glasgow's electronic music scenes. After a recent move to Berlin, the textures of Glasgow's musical strains have fused into an accessible and friendly mix of poppy melodic electronica built from a stricter 'less is more' sound pallete, closer in spirit to the music of his adopted city. It is also a record which was made in opposition to recent music he has been hearing, in particular the troubled, dark and noisy experimental music coming out of Berlin. Tom wanted to focus on more joyful qualities, making this a record imbued with warmth and happiness, a panacea to the darkness and disorientation all around in 2019. Having a social scene full of producers has also influenced the album. The opening track 'LA Melody' came from staying with Ross Birchard (Hudson Mohawke) at his house in LA, hanging out in the glorious sunshine with him and Lunice working on tracks. \"Initially Ross asked me to write some melodies to use in a project he was producing, but I ended up liking it so much I decided to keep the riff. I generally write music alone, but being around other producers gave me a certain excited energy that reminded me of after-parties back in Glasgow where Ross and myself spent our youth together. Spending time in Clark's studio also helped me improve my workflow and sequencing the album by seeing the way he does things\".

Since their last album, the band relocated from the suburbs of the Midwest to the sinister shine of Los Angeles. The cover’s icicle is the last remnant of their time in familiar surroundings. More change was to follow. A duo for most of its existence, Clay Rendering’s core of Mike and Tara Connelly chose to invite two allies into their closed circle. The enlisted are Sera Timms of Black Mare on bass and Joe Potts of Sollilja on drums. The album reveals itself slowly for the first minutes of “Blood Into Wine”, until the refrain opens wide and dives headlong into the deep. It’s a statement of intent. Whatever happens after this, we are in it together. From there, things rev up with uncertainty and a nervous edge. “Another Roll of the Iron Dice”...whose number is up? Tara takes on more vocals than previous records, haunting the nocturnal ocean with “Once in the Well,” “Black Vows” and “Take Hold.” Strangers come and go and dance and die in “We Wait.” Questions remain unanswered in “Don’t Understand You.” With Dylan Neal (Thief) on production duties, Clay Rendering have delivered their fullest and most fleshed out album to date. The immediacy of the recording gives the feel that these songs are taking shape as you hear them. Guitars melt over the keyboards and synths throughout the proceedings. The record is filled with a noir life force that transitions back and forth from desperate wails to moonlit hymns. The vocals are clearer and more direct than ever, letting you know exactly where Clay Rendering stand. The bass provides the heartbeat of the mission. The drums ensure everything lands in its place. Insomnia, frantic flailing, body language, staring into the forced and artificial landscape, finding solace among the chaotic foliage...all these things play a role. The comfort has been shed. Foreboding stars in the western lands bring out the strangest parts in us all. “California Black Vows” is the howling cry to let those parts show their teeth and the soothing voice to let you know it will all be over in the morning.” less"

Features guest input from Jacob Samuel, Kenta Sekine, Rupert Clevaux, Bianca Scout ++ “Following on from last year’s rapturously received Assimilation, London-based saxophonist, improviser and producer Ben Vince returns with Don't Give Your Life. Over the last few years, Vince’s solo saxophone and electronics performances, along with his work in the clattering post-punk troupe, Housewives, have helped him quickly establish a considerable reputation among those in the know. Where his first releases under his name honed in on his meditatively layered and looped saxophone lines – placing him in a lineage beginning with the Time Lag Accumulator works of Terry Riley and stretching into the icy expanses of John Surman’s 1980s recordings and the hypnotic riffing of Gilbert Artman’s Urban Sax – Assimilation saw Vince branching out to work with high-profile collaborators such as Micachu and demonstrating his deep love of the outer reaches of club music (also evident on last year’s collaborative 12” with UK bass music bigwig Joy Orbison). Don't Give Your Life is the strongest work yet from an artist whose work demonstrates a risk-taking, omnivorous appetite for the new while also digging deeper and deeper into a unique sonic sensibility.” less"

   "name": "A Lovely Music touchstone, ‘Trust In Rock’ is what happened when the ‘70s West Coast experimental avant-garde made rock music. Now issued for the first time, this is a proper piece of history that would come to inform Lovely Music’s earliest releases... “Trust in Rock documents the last evening of an epic concert series held at Berkeley’s University Art Museum in November 1976, featuring an all-star ensemble of the Bay Area’s most unclassifiable musicians performing works by “Blue” Gene Tyranny and Peter Gordon. Tyranny’s cycle “No Job, No Warm, No Nothing” contains songs “concerned with influence, trust, self-reliance, and having to re-do what is true for you;” three songs by Gordon, with lyrics by Kathy Acker, are complimented by two earlier instrumental works. Their combined band crossed styles and institutions and time, and was assembled from the effervescence of the Bay Area scene in the 1970s. It included Gordon on saxes and the RMI Synthesizer; Tyranny on the piano; local video-performance artist Patrice Manget on vocals; Carl Young on saxes; composer-performer-guitarist Paul Dresher, who played in Tyranny’s band Edge of the Road along with percussionist Gene Reffkin; Steve Bartek of the Mystic Knights of Oingo Boingo on bass; and Mills College student Janet Cuniberti on the funky Clavinet and RMI Synth. Though some of the works on Trust in Rock also appear on Gordon’s Star Jaws and Tyranny’s Out of the Blue, many others are available here for the first time. Trust in Rock contains nearly two hours of what Ear magazine called “NEW MUSIC FOR ROCK BAND.” Except: by 1976, the idea of a capitalized “New Music” had increasingly lost its punch for Tyranny and Gordon. Rock and Roll, likewise, was nearing an apparent generational expiration. The way out of this impasse was trust in rock, which was both description and command. Rock, for this all-star cast of Bay Area heads, became a perpetual revolution that could be serious, playful, polemic, focused, technical, and lovely. And you can hear it in the music: Tyranny’s songs swing from intimate and profound to blissful and joyous, with solos on saxophone, piano, synthesizer, and electric guitar over interlocking rhythmic and melodic cells; an ecstatic performance of Gordon’s “Machomusic” gives a single pitch the real Rock’n’Roll treatment; and Acker’s lyrics on “God’s a Man,” “When Baby Gets Wet,” and “Cloves and Cinnamon” pulse with transgressive sexual energy. This is neither New Music nor Rock as anybody had previously understood those terms, but something else entirely—a kind of transcendent synthesis that audibly reveled in its newfound energy. On Trust in Rock, Tyranny, Gordon, and their band played at, with, and through not only the generic boundaries of New Music and Rock, but also the stylistic boundaries of minimalism, jam bands, and punk. Tyranny had quit Iggy Pop’s band in 1973; Gordon had already moved to New York and began playing with Arthur Russell and Rhys Chatham. That night in the University Art Museum, playing saxophones and and synthesizers, they were not afraid to trust in rock to get them where they needed to be. This was a band that was not afraid to “listen to the interior state of something,” as Tyranny later put it: they put their trust in rock, and this album lets us hear what happened.” less"

   "name": "Following their acclaimed opera-in-suspension about Fugazi, NYC’s Object Collection imagine a delirium of transhuman thought and progressive politics on their return to the inimitable Slip label. ‘You Are Under Our Space Control’ sees the duo of Kara feely (text) and travis just (music) refocus their “operatic” sensibilities into a typically confounding “space-opera” that somehow ties up references as wide reaching as John Cage’s 1951 piano solo ‘Music Of Changes’, with Cy Roth’s sci-fi ‘Fire Maidens From Outer Space’ from the same year, as well as texts inspired by Sun Ra and the Russian Cosmists’ poetics and philosophies, and interviews from real (and imagined) space travellers and astronomers. Aye, it’s a proper headful of ideas, and understandably chaotic with it, but OC’s make a virtue of somehow maintaining a coherence though their sharply chopped arrangements, which start out tightly puckered, but gradually loosen up into more sprawling, psychedelic designs as the album proceeds. What happens in its 18 parts is comparable to a sort of home-brewed sci-fi soundtrack imagined by a teenaged dream-team of Todd Dockstader, Bruce Haack, and Sonny Blount; a sound full of mercurial wormholes, with an animist capacity to rouse arcane spirits, and a magnetic pull to the most restlessly searching listeners of the weird and wonderful. Most crucially, for an album rooted in ‘50s sci-fi and avant-garde, the results prize that era’s modernist promise without coming off as retrogressive or corny. less"

   "name": "‘Commissioned Work’ is a fascinating testament to the diversity of AGF’s compositions, focussing on her abstract electronic works for theatre, radio, classical ensemble, contemporary dance, installation and film work. Make sure to check out ‘smell of DAT (score)’ and the incisive inceptions of ‘myzelimPRO’ “This album is quite gentle I hope, with a few exceptions. In the last years I have been commissioned audio pieces under remarkable circumstances and I did not want to loose them to rotting hard drives. As the album title states, it is about work. Writing, performing, handling music is work. I mean that in an absolute Marxist sense. The works were written for a specific purpose like radio, theater, classical ensemble, contemporary dance, installations, film and video work. With permission of the commissioners the pieces have been thoroughly reworked for this release and are now compressed \"moods\" of the originals or some are processes and combinations. Making this release was more complicated than expected and made me think about \"composition\" in general and how I perceive it. I drew it out on the cover artwork: position - sound - composition. Along the process it manifested the practice of sculpting audio, my process of \"writing\" music is closer to poetry or sculpture than the one of a classic composer or musician. Important steps like research, thinking, building a context, forming a position, collecting sound within the context, sound design, purpose, attitude, politics and eventually crafting something that is narrative or listenable in the format it is presented. I spent a lot of time finding the right tracklisting to allow a dynamic interesting listening experience of the entire work. As an electronic composer I used diverse sampling techniques, field recordings, my voice and multiple layers of digital processing and eventually mixing and mastering. One will hear machine sounds like an East German grass cutter, a 3D food printing machine, syringes, bells, human chatter, one will hear the endangered tree-dwelling mammal species Indri \"singing\" a song, sonified mushrooms going wild, mycelium compositions, police dogs smelling data, ice hockey recordings from the ice court in Hailuoto (Finland), where kids play all winter only when they do not play Fortnite, one can hear rural field recordings and my body amplified with a contact microphone. Melody on this record is minimal and derived from the field, rather led towards dissonance as a form of resistance to harmony.

Lizard Strategies? Void Spirit...? These bizarre titles are just a few of the self-coined terms that Australian electronic musician Ian MacFarlane has conjured to represent his eccentric sonic world. An artist whose unique style of electronic experimentalism has balanced dangerously close to the edge of popular convention, existing outside the mainstream and extending well beyond the fringe of any sanctioned independent scene. A futurist outsider whose extraordinary musical vision has explored the uncharted realms of consciousness and fantasy. Following a brief stint with the legendary Australian Krautrockers Cybotron, MacFarlane produced three independent solo albums throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. His debut LP Void Spirit, an experimental album issued under the pen name ‘Violet Lightning’, was followed by a further two albums published under his own name, the cosmic influenced Back From Beyond and finally the privately issued electro-ambient suite Planetarium. Presented with hours of unreleased home recordings, The Roundtable has begun a dedicated search through the fascinating archives of this under exposed artist. Beginning with a vinyl release of the rare cassette-only album Planetarium; this private press sees MacFarlane armed with a bank of Roland synthesizers, drum machines and field recordings, spawning a mutant amalgam of German Kosmische Musik, French Library Electro and Private Issue New Age.

   "name": "Remarkable set of compositions for violin that more or less reshapes what we know of the instrument in three different but equally startling and compelling ways. Oh there’s also an incredible remix from Actress as a digital bonus, did we say? What a f#cking record! The fact that Galya Bisengalieva's pedigree working with everyone from Radiohead to Frank Ocean is the least interesting thing about this record should give you an idea of what we’re dealing with here. Leader of the LCO, Bisengalieva demonstrates on her second EP that genuinely “modern” classical music has nothing to do with the kind of middle class music for numbness so often associated with the term. Instead, and with the help of a couple of choice collaborators (more on which later), Bisengalieva methodically broadens parameters, rooted in a deep knowledge of the classics but not bound by them, in a daring pursuit of the new. Opener 'Zohra’ was composed and recorded with avant-turntablist Shiva Feshareki, where Galya responds to Shiva’s extended turntable techniques with the recorded results then cut to dubplate and used in a duet between violin and turntable. It’s a jagged and to our mind completely unprecedented mix of keening dissonance and splintered junglism with a gripping focus on the physicality and resonance of their sound. To say that it sounds more like Photek then Erased Tapes should tell you all you need to know. Galya’s own ‘Umay’ follows with a necessary contrast to the opener. Taking cues from the titular goddess of the earth and fertility in the Tengriism religion of the Mongolian and Hunnic empires - a protector of women and children - Galya mounts an almost overwhelming maelstrom of whirling strings and guttural, ragged low end that literally reflects the goddess’ mythical, radiant solar form with 60 (!!!) layers of electronically manipulated violin drones interwoven with virtuosic passages and driven by a “drum machine” built from recordings of a Shankobyz (a reed-based Kazakh instrument). Chaines brings an otherworldly nature to the plate with ‘Claycorn’, a fantastic piece teeming with insectoid detail and chattering, characterful electronics which draws much influence from the animation of award-winning Czech game developer Amanita Design. Together with the gasping, hoofing machine rhythms and dreamlike wind-tunnel dynamic of Actress’ ’26 Drones’ remix of ‘Tulpar’ available as a digital bonus, it all adds up to one of the most thrilling expositions of new music we’ve heard this year. less"

Unmissable hard rave tackle if yr into Nkisi, Caustic Window, The Mover, Stay Up Forever, Maflannagan Skajellafetti... The punkish reputation of Live Adult Entertainment precedes them as one of the underground’s keenest yet elusive operations to emerge in recent years. Based in Thessaloniki, a port city in northern Greece, they’ve released some 28 tapes, CDR’s and lathe cut vinyl of musick ranging from psy-trance to industrial noise and concrète since 2017, and always in editions ranging from zero to 20 tops, leading to feverish and frustrated reactions from those listeners who’ve chanced upon their YouTube videos before they get taken down. Finally, this 12” features the first readily available and properly mastered LAE material on a physical format. On the A-side, Endangered Species label boss Oliver Vereker adopts his gabber alias Service Animal for his first outing proper since appearing as Renoir on his label’s 2017 CD, ‘Death Always Follows’. Revolving material originally available on tape in an edition of 20 copies, it boots off with the 12-hp hoof and dive-bombing drones of ‘Core Of Reality’ next to the evil Arcardipane styles of ‘F.T.W’, which are both produced with the same, powerful conviction in charred black metal, noise and hardcore techno that made his 2015 releases as Restraint and Grace so vital, only with added acceleration and syncopation. The B-side follows with a pair of seething workouts from the ‘Cyber Afterbirth Vol.1’ mix by LAE co-owner, Crime Unit. Hearkening back to a sound that was ubiquitous between Hackney Warehouses and small-town UK/European techno clubs in the late ’90s/early ‘00s, they are ravenous examples of the LAE aesthetic, applying scuzzy DIY principles to gnashing German schranz and adrenalising acid trance with ruthlessly direct results that pack one of the meanest breakdowns you’ll hear this year.

He continues to rudely shape the dancehall in his own style with ‘Jingles du Lieu-dit’, packing innovative mutations picking up where his screwed industrial dancehall edits left off last year. Churning up pendulous grooves in acres of murky dub space with a patented sleight-of-hand, these are oscillating weightless, dematerialised, and heavily present, turning the dancehall into a flux of ‘90s ragga mutations and now ting reggaeton, leaving its rugged structures notably free of vocals but full of characterful samples, idents, and studio elves that can’t help but connote the artist’s moodily crafty and kinetic style, lying right on the cusp of darkside and party-ready concerns. Up in it, he executes a scything re-chop on Richard Browne’s ‘Baddis’ riddim teasing out its eastern motifs into woozy shapes on ‘More Speed’, whereas ‘Dinner’ exerts a hypnotic spin on reggaeton’s rub ’n tug rhythms and ’Shell’ spirals headlong into a vortex of soundsystem ephemera.

In the three years since he introduced the world to his Baltic Beat, Bartosz Kruczyński has traded dub techno, Berlin electronics and jazzy Balearic on a string of highly regarded labels. Now the Polish musician is back in the Growing Bin, ready to take us on another audio adventure through the meadows and forests of his native land. Vivid LP opener ‘Pastoral Sequences’ leads us down the garden path, around the lakeside and across the train tracks, striking a cinematic tone as gentle piano and subdued synth tones drift around natural field recordings. Dip a toe in the stream and feel the breeze between your fingers as you stroll towards the Balearic brilliance of ‘In the Garden’, a carefree cooler built on a subtle bossa rhythm, serene chords and chiming mallets. Bartosz reprises the aquatic grandeur of his first Baltic Beat on the immersive ‘Petals’, a selected ambient work where Tangerine pads underpin interlocking electronics and stately keys. Guitars ring out, Reich’s mallets ripple and well tempered piano drift over a thick sequence as ‘Voices’ propels us to the halfway point with soft power. The B-side opens with the delicate hypnotism of ‘If You Go Down In The Woods Today’, a modern minimalist masterpiece alive with circular mallets and sultry woodwind, before ‘The Orchard’ paints an impressionistic vignette from the same palette. Shifting focus but not feeling Kruczyński takes us home ‘Along The Sun Drenched Road’ in two stages; the first a gorgeous combination of the acoustic and electronic where hints of dub techno sit beneath languid piano notes, the second an eastern tinged reprise of the album’s opening and a welcome return home before the storm breaks.” less"

   "name": "Never has a defrosting refrigerator or a dripping pipe sounded so poetic as on Anne Tardos’ entrancing ‘Gatherings’ recordings, which now become a crucial part of Sean McCann’s Recital programme alongside the label’s modern classics by Sarah Davachi. Proper find. Recorded at various points over 1974-1981 in NYC, the enigmatic mix of observant location recordings and layered vocal improv in ‘Gatherings’ was originally issued on tape in 1982 as part of the New Wilderness project’s Audiographics series; a little-known treasure trove of avant-garde art music explorations including great works by Annea Lockwood, Phillip Corner, and Charlie Morrow (who provides the sleevenotes here), which only recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. Coincidentally, we stumbled across ‘Gatherings’ after falling heavily for Recital’s R.I.P. Hayman side ‘Dreams of India & China’, which lead down the rabbithole to New Wilderness Audiographics and inevitably their Anne Tardos tape. No hyperbole, our first meeting with ‘Gatherings’ supplied one of those rare, subtle epiphanies when the music gets right under your skin and you can’t shift it. Under the unflinching gaze of a fixed position microphone, Anne’s recordings of her refrigerator dripping while defrosting had and still have us rapt to their elemental pulse, and when she started singing you could put a fork in us, we’re done! Heard from inside the fridge in a way that pre-echoes Peter Rehberg & General Magic’s ‘Fridge Trax’ by decades, ‘Refrigerator Defrosting’ happily and most poetically gives new meaning to Peder Mannerfelt’s idea of “domestic techno”, while Anne’s documentation of ‘Pipes at 110 Mercer, November 1974’ uncannily resembles the irregularities of a free jazz drummer at his loosest, or even playing off some algorithmic bleep track dialled back in time from Mark Fell. It’s literally just a fridge dripping and the heating pipes playing up, but somehow it’s one of the most thrilling listens in recent memory. Factor in the deeply strange tape compositions of 1980’s ‘Seven-Layer Song’, the other dimensional drone of ‘Voices of Video’, and the voyeuristic 10 minutes of ‘Real Sleeper / Real Dreamer’ and you have one of those most elusive beauties, an avant-garde obscurity that’s never testing and simply, utterly, strangely life-affirming in its dreamy evocation of everyday reality. less"

   "name": "Crushing Metal alchemy from Jack Adams (Mumdance) and James Kelly (Altar Of Plagues, Wife), committing a ravishing assault on the senses in their debut album as Bliss Signal Originally conceived as a live project for Unsound Krakow 2017, Bliss Signal bloomed into a full studio project with recent release of their ‘Drift EP’, and this towering debut album now cements the duo’s efforts in bridging the ostensibly, mutually exclusive fields of Black Metal and electronic rave music. And we say ostensibly because, in 2018, this kind of hybridisation shouldn’t be seen as novel or even unlikely, but rather as a necessary experiment in diversifying bonds, building bridges and finding commonality between fringe or extreme styles and communities. On the one hand, James Kelly brings a wealth of experience to the project, from playing in lauded BM group Altar Of Plagues, to his forays into emosh electronica as Wife, while adept collaborator Jack Adams logically leads on from his work with Logos and Shapednoise in The Sprawl (also an Unsound commissioned project) to bring powerful sound designer skills and a rave-hungry temperament to the table. The result of their endeavours is a blistering bind of styles, matching the bloodied and bludgeoning repetition of BM proper with the body-focussed momentum of hard dance music. But the results exceed the sum of its parts thanks to the artist’s deep, experiential knowledge of their genre’s cliches, and their concerted effort to consolidate those styles while generating something new in the process. It’s possible to find precedents for this music in the fringe lunacy of Wold and its Black Mecha output, but Bliss Signal tend toward feats of chest-bursting emotion rooted in the feeling of communal reverie and ecstasy, both negative and positive, that comes with raves and big stage gigs. Factor in mixing by Jaime Gomez-Arellano (Paradise Lost, Sunn 0))), Ghost) and mastering at Abbey Road Studios, and you’ve got a steeply impressive sound. less"

   "name": "Debut release from award-winning violinist and member of The London Contemporary Orchestra Galya Bisengalieva, occasional Radiohead, Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Frank Ocean and Actress collaborator. On this EP she performs her own work as well as pieces composed by Claire M. Singer (Touch) and Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch, another award-winning artist who records for FatCat’s post-classical label 130701. The A-side's ’tùs is a majestic piece written by Singer, a soaring, widescreen drone inspired by Glencoe, an extinct volcano in the Highlands of Scotland. At 10 minutes it’s the longest piece on the record, and uses a mixture of strings, organ and electronics to beautifully limn an awe-inspiring sense of space. What starts as a barely-there wheeze of bowed strings builds into an almost grandiose, panoramic soundscape that will be easily recognisable to anyone who has visited or even seen the breathtaking, rugged wilds of Northern Scotland. On the other side Bisengalieva opens with ’TULPAR’. in a marked contrast to the A-side’s billowing, sustained drones, she here uses her violin rhythmically to animate the winged horse of Kazakh mythology, connoting the sensation of quick, galloping hooves and massive, beating wings in the lower ends. More complex and insular, this is the sound of the violin as pitched at an atomic scale; intimate and alien. Emelie Levienaise-Farrouch seals the EP with ‘Oparin’, which takes inspiration from Alexander Ivanovich’s theories about the origins of life in the primordial soup. Her vision takes flight here, conjuring a hugely dynamic play of stereo strafing strings and breathlessly high register electronics that connote chaos and tension in the first 2/3rds, then bloom into wilder discord and romantic sweeps implying danger and beauty in the final section. less"

   "name": "Meitei follows the ghostly beauty found on the sublime Kwaidan tape with a second album of minimalist and fragrant ambient scenery for Séance Centre’s outlet for Japanese music, Métron. Doubling the label’s tally after 7FO’s ‘Moment’ 2LP, ‘Komachi’ yields a more serene angle to Meitei’s music in 12 instrumental parts rippling with fleeting melodies, fringed by delicate location recordings, and arranged in a naturally time-slipping ebb and flow. While super pretty and functional as ambient scenery to immerse in, the music’s careful pruned structuring specifically speaks to the artist’s preoccupation with Japanese cultures, traditions and atmospheres that have become lost in translation with age, and particularly with the loss of his 99-year old grandmother, whom he believed was among the last Japanese people to take with her the true experience and understanding of traditional Japanese ambience. ‘Komachi’ is therefore dedicated to Meitei’s grandmother, and draws from classical Japanese artform of Gagaku, as well as environmental sounds of water, bird calls, and white noise as air, in a way that reflects the work of Japan’s ’80s ambient pioneers, and their ‘90s antecedents such as Susumu Yokota and Nobukazu Takemura, and how they synthesised electronic music to reflect Japanese tradition and its intangible ambience. Each of the album’s tracks limn a specific scene with the lightest brushstrokes and tonal shading, conjuring a series of dreamlike situations connected by a flickering narrative thread that comes out in style of jazz-wise freedom also shared by the likes of Foodman and Visible Cloaks, both artists who share Meitei’s skill for making the invisible almost real, and for exquisitely rendering and preserving Japan’s enigmatic soul in sound. less"

Blue is a Grammy-nominated composer and pianist who has performed on records by Robert Ashley (Perfect Lives), John Cage, and Laurie Anderson, yet this is quite different. Composing for what is essentially a chamber rock ensemble, a cast of female vocalists, and himself on the Polymoog and RMI synthesizers, Blue has created a song-cycle that reflects his intensely melodic and free piano technique in a polished studio record. Out of the Blue elegantly combines adventurous New Music technique, the style and appeal of pop music, and the grace of classical music to form an unclassifiable and totally revelatory whole. Endearing, exciting, familiar yet unlike anything else – this is a very friendly record.” less"

'Henning Christansen: Freedom is Around the Corner' is released in conjunction with a retrospective exhibition and performance series of the same name, devoted to the work of pioneering Daish composer and artist Henning Christiansen (1932-2008). Perhaps best known for his collaborations and artistic affinities with notable artists such as Joseph Beuys and Fluxus members like Nam June Paik and Dick Higgins, Christiansen, who worked primarily on the remote Danish island of Møn, moved beyond his Fluxus-oriented roots to create a vast, often ineffable body of work that spanned music, performance, film, and visual art over the course of a fifty-year career. Yet Christiansen’s work has remained under the radar, even in the ten years following his death: only a few of his recordings were available until recently, and his prolific compositional and visual outputs have rarely been performed or exhibited in the United States. Freedom is Around the Corner— the exhibition, the performance series, and the journal— seek to present Christiansen’s life and work in a holistic, varied manner that befits his dynamic practice. less"

Packed with hits, it’s an album that’s endured and grown in stature over the years, setting the template for innovative R&B in a way that was perhaps hard to anticipate following Janet’s first couple of bubblegum albums 'Janet Jackson', and 'Dream Street’. On ‘Control’, Janet broke away from pretty much everyone around her; her father/manager Joe Jackson, her husband, and most of her entourage, relocating to Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis where Jam & Lewis pushed her towards a much edgier sound. “We were going for the black album of all time...\" With initial track sketches recorded on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard and originally intended for Sharon Bryant, lyrics and production were re-configured and engineered with Jam & Lewis playing synths, drums and piano, with Janet adding arrangements and playing keyboard parts. With iconic artwork provided by well known photographer and illustrator Tony Viramontes, the template was set for a new kind of R&B/pop variant that still sounds fresh almost 4 decades later, packed with hooks and falling firmly into the lineage of great Minneapolis albums that stand out as the definitive innovative pop records of the era. less"

   "name": "Issued posthumously, ‘Petra (1991) For Two Pianos’ is the first ever vinyl pressing of music by Maryanne Amacher (1938-2009), one of the early “gurus” of electronic music, who is revered for her explorations of “otoacoustic emissions” - acoustic phenomena where the listener’s ears produce audible sound. One of a handful of Maryanne’s works for tape, ‘Petra (1991) For Two Pianos’ joins her seminal Tzadik CD releases ‘Sound Characters (Making The Third Ear)’ [1999] and ‘Sound Characters 2 (Making Sonic Space)’ [2008] as only the 3rd official release of Maryanne Amacher’s remarkably unique music. However, where her first two albums were crucially created with electronic sources, this one aims to generate the same effect with two acoustic instruments simultaneously presenting pure tones, and in a way links her otoacoustic exploitations back to the phenomenon’s discovery by 18th century Italian violinist, Giuseppe Tartini. This much anticpated Blank Forms release of ‘Petra’ is a recording of its American premiere on May 4th, 2017, at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church on West 20th Street, NYC, performed by Marianne Schroeder, a Swiss pianist specialising in New Music, and Stefan Tcherepnin - great-grandson of the legendary Serge. Originally commissioned for the ISCM World Music Days in Switzerland, and written for two pianos, ’Petra’ forms a unique extension of Amacher’s electronic working methods, requiring a poised precision and patience from the players who segue from glacially reverberant serenity to passages of ragged dissonance, taking the music into realms shared by Amacher’s inspirations, Giancinto Scelsi and Galina Ustvolskaya, while also subtly manifesting the piece’s literary influence from sci-fi writer Greg Bears’s short story of the same title, where the gargoyles of Notre Dame come to life and breed with humans in an apocalyptic future. The first part is ashen solemn, but struck thru with flashes of exhilarating high register colour, with lots of spooky action found in between the notes, where one can practically feel the church’s architecture impressed in-ear like a watermark. The 2nd part is much more dynamic, riddled with surprises and shadowplay, turning dread-heavy and rhythmically forceful before Schroeder and Tcherepnin gently bring the notes down like leaves on a slow-spiralling autumnal descent, conversely amplifying an uncanny space between the keys and leaving listeners utterly enchanted, aware of their space and presence in a deeply unique manner. less"

Her own vocals feature prominently, and there are guests too - notably King Aus on, er, 'Aus' - but these performances never feel tokenistic or grafted on. Recent single 'Ghetto Kraviz' is included and still sounds fresh, viewing Dance Mania bumpage through a prism of narced-out Teutonic minimalism, with stalactite-like strings that remind us of those Lost Trax 12\"s from a few years back. Sophisticated, moody blue deep housers like 'Taxi Talk', 'Choices' and 'False Attraction' form the backbone of the album, but inevitably it's the more off-kilter cuts that keep us locked: '4 Ben' sounds like the missing link between Cluster and Carl Craig, 'Love You Go' is a pop-acid stomp the likes of which we haven't heard since electroclash and 'Best Friend' is Chi-house elegantly unspooled, the sound of Omar-S falling asleep at the wheel of his souped-up motor. less"

   "name": "Burial’s sophomore LP, originally issued in 2007 only a year after his pivotal debut, is another masterpiece of urban UK composition and innovative imagineering whose sense of melancholic space, pop-wise dexterity and dancefloor yearn has rarely been explored or surpassed since its release. Where its predecessor was starkly paranoid, mostly instrumental, Untrue was gilded with gorgeous, cut-up R&B and UKG vox, and interspersed with segments of nocturnal reverie that played out like the OST for a yung UK romance that replaced posh, gurning actors with real life road characters and focussed on the spaces between - between the club and home; between night and day; masculine and feminine; waking life and dream life; Maccy D’s and alley doorways; being high AF and coming down. It was and still is Burial’s love note to UKG and R&G, and by turns gave context and validated those genres for a lot of listeners who arguably wouldn’t have touched that sound, or at least dismissed it as pop pap or with some snide, racist undertone before Burial’s revivalist instincts hybridised it with trip hop and snarling D&B memes. More positively, however, depending on which way you look at it, this album also opened the endorphin floodgates for a whole raft of f****e garage producers to get in touch with their feminine side, especially in contrast to prevailing, laddish dubstep rave trends, and, since that sound has faded away, it’s not hard to hear this album’s influence in the vocal processing of Mssingno, in the uneven, off-kilter swing and parry of Zomby, the patch-worked constructions of Jamie xx or Evian Christ, or in Deadboy and Murlo’s more boundary-pushing creations. As with any album that gets a lot of attention beyond its putative scene, Untrue was an unintended red rag to the cynics and rockists - and even garage purists - but for almost anyone who recognises and appreciates that more modest, aching sort of electronic, UK street rave soul, it remains a really transcendent album that still grips like few others. less"

With a crack squad including O’Malley on guitar and additional production from gifted sound designers Randall Dunn, Pepijn Caudron (Kreng) and Berlin’s Yair Elazar Glotman (Ketev), the results lurk like blinking red eyes in a dense nocturnal forest, swarming in formation from widescreen romance to petrifying, plangent cues and pockets of heart-sinking gloom, saving the gnashing guitars for when their bite is felt strongest, but equally knowing how to send shivers shooting down the spine in moments of sublime, contrasting relief on the ‘Memories’ theme. Jóhannsson's deft approach to sonic extremities is the real eye opener here; far removed from the emotionally driven demands of his more mainstream work for hollywood, here we're taken through grinding, industrial metal scrapes one minute and insanely rich ambient textures the next - with no concession to soaring emotional cues. Not that Jóhannsson ever really succumbed to much of that; but nonetheless - it’s a total pleasure to hear him reach into those darker recesses on Mandy - a soundtrack that’s likely to be remembered as one of his best.

Featuring stately, immersive compositions for brass, strings, solo piano, woodwind and electronics, it’s a startling, full-bodied approach that places 'The Entertainer’ well outside the current taste for more disposable ambient and environmental recordings, and for our money, one of the great albums of the year so far. Best known for his work as Mirror To Mirror, Twomey has been largely absent from our airwaves since his last release for the Preservation label in 2012, an album we described at the time as sounding somewhere between Jeff Witscher’s Rene Hell and ‘Victorialand’-era Cocteau Twins. The 7 year pause for thought has pushed Twomey into much more introspective and interesting terrain; weaving orchestral elements around his still searching electronic foundations. He takes us from the breathless opener \"Red Zone” - reminding us of the tragi-romantic opulence of Kara-Lis Coverdale’s still peerless ‘Aftertouches’, and into the overflowing brass arrangements of 'Pig Symphony’, sounding like a Disney scene re-purposed into minor key solemnity - like a funeral march rendered in pastels. ‘Fun in Vegas’ and 'Velvet on Foam’ each deploy two minutes of gauzy bliss, alongside the barely contained emotional minimalism of 'Just Drinking’, while 'Driving Home’ soars to almost Vangelis levels of sci-fi romance. Modest in length, each of 'The Entertainer’s’ 11 pieces clock in between 2 and 4 minutes long, acting like \"vignettes alluding to a vague narrative”. But the duration belies a richness of ideas and honesty in execution that’s inspiring to behold, taking us on an often wrenching emotional journey that’s, above all, highly believable. Or as the label put so well “...melodies dance as twinkling bulbs along a retired parade float. A dark comedy, a tragic smile. Love found in the rough of it all.\" less"

Killer set!!! It’s maybe fair to say that, during the golden era for ambient and electronic dance music - roughly the period covered in this comp - Brazil’s contributions have been largely overlooked in the Western world. ‘Outro Tempo II: Electronic and Contemporary Music From Brazil, 1984-1996’ seeks to remedy this with a cherry-picked overview of this epoch that highlights spellbinding works by Mitar Subotić (aka Serbian producer Sub/Rex Ilusivii, tipped off by Vladimir Ivkovic) alongside stacks of uniquely humid, sensuous, feverishly psychedelic visions from artists you’ve likely never heard before. Mitar Subotić is credited on three highlights, including a gem in ‘Velvet’ from his psychedelic samba-rock project Angel’s Breath, and Faust Fawcett serves standouts with his Lena Platonos-like ‘Império Dos Sentidos’ and the slunky bump of ‘Shopping De Voodoos’, but if it’s straight-up dancefloor heat and percussion that you’re (understandably) looking for, then it’s best to check out peaches such as May East’s woozy batacuda ‘Maraka’, the spaced-out, psychy slosh of Akira S, the lithe but smudged jazz-fusion shimmy of ‘Ilha Grande’ by Jorge Degas & Marcelo Salazar, and what sounds like one of James Ferraro’s ‘Far Side Virtual’ workouts, but with fruity, squawking vocals in ‘Guero-Guero’ by Tetê Espíndola. less"

Scored by none other than ex-Tangerine Dream/Ash Ra Tempel drummer and German electronic music pioneer Klaus Schulze, the music featured in the film was a unique hybrid of pulsing Giallo-moods and hypnotic Berlin-School electronica. Due to the limited availability of the film over the years, rumours have long circulated amongst horror film fans as well as ‘Krautrock’ enthusiasts alike that a lost Klaus Schulze soundtrack existed. Commissioned to write the score, it is true that Schulze composed an original full-length soundtrack for Next Of Kin, although for editorial reasons the complete score was rejected at the last moment by the filmmakers in favour of using pre-existing tracks from Schulze’s studio albums. The final soundtrack consisted of partial elements of this rejected score together with various pieces of early 80s Schulze recordings edited and re-contextualized. Finally rediscovered, the music has been assembled and presented here exactly as featured in the film, documenting a previously lost entry of German Kosmische Musik soundtracking a forgotten piece of Australian Gothic.” less"

Comprised of corresponding compositional triptychs on each of its two sides - the final act of both featuring contributions from experimental music heavyweights, Rodrigo D’Erasmo on violin and David Grubbs on piano, the album builds vast, inhabitable expanses of ambience from long tones and shattered cuts and collisions, punctuated by clusters, sweeps, and careful interventions of texture and note. In Girum Imus Nocte Et Consumimur Igni – as this eerie palindrome and endecasillabo (a syntactic form in classical Italian verse) from Virgil suggests – moves through a path of alchemical symbolic narratives and poetic abstraction humbly reminiscent and allegorically inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy and by the Nekyia (‘evocation of the dead’) parts found in Book IX of Homer’s Odyssey. Based on symmetrical harmonic, melodic and narrative properties and filled with intangible narrative, haunting abstraction, fleeting visions of eerie space, and slow motion melody, Girum Imus Nocte Et Consumimur Igni pushes electroacoustic music toward symphonic dimensions - dramatic arcs with echoes of high Minimalism, historic ambient music, and the radicalism indeterminate forms. Through a wise, peculiar and abstracted use of guitar instrumentation, the sound surface of the compositions reaches deeper electroacoustic-symphonic dimensions, echoing minimalist works, ambient music and indeterminate contemporary forms.” less"

   "name": "Aye this one's a goodun. Japanese grindcore icon Eri Fuzz-Kristiansen, aka Viviankrist, keeps the curveballs coming on Diagonal with her bloodied mastication of charred noise and rhythmic electronics, following up the label’s acclaimed recent sides by Sote and Not Waving/Jim O’Rourke. It's an intense howl of a record that comes highly recommended if yr into anything from Alberich/Prurient to Aphex Twin’s Ventolin, Pan Sonic to Kali Malone. ‘Cross-Modulation’ is a brutal testament to the acridly personalised sound that Viviankrist has explored solo since 1995 in Tokyo, when she performed vocals, sax and SP-202 sampler in her first industrial/noise unit. 23 years later her music is still sorely raw, yet riddled with a new found poignance and atmospheric unease that places her music sometimes as close to Kali Malone’s see-sawing dissonance as the power electronics of Pan Sonic or the possessed pulses of Conrad Schnitzler and Merzbow. Since the demise of Eri’s main project Gallhammer at the start of this decade, when she moved from Tokyo to Oslo (home of her husband and bandmate in Sehnsucht, Maniac - also former vocalist for BM legends Mayhem), she returned to her early Viviankrist alias from 2017 as a place to express her primitivist-futurist urges, resulting a trio of CDs including the vicious solo strike of ‘Morgenrøde’ for Cold Spring. Now on ‘Cross-Modulation’ she intuitively tempers that album’s phosphorous burn with a deadly, incisive application of what Black Metal/Techno pioneer Black Mecha terms “mentation electronics.” Alloying avant-metal with rhythmic noise, ambient techno and mind-bending drone to a metallurgic tang, ‘Cross-Modulation’ serves a dense flux of energies in seven parts, piercing a path thru maelstrom electronics in ‘Eleventh’ to churn up grizzled Vainio-esque rhythms in ‘Blue Iron’, while the tenderly bruised ambience of ‘Midnight Sun’ provides a bittersweet palette cleanser for the tart technoid prang of ‘Insects’, a bout of slow gripping psychedelia in ‘Out of Body’, and the rugged North European pastoralism of ‘Behind Mirror.’ Blinder. less"

Covered in rain, during the days and even the nights, Shanghai was lit in a glow, a mist turning to a constant grey fog. Buildings lined with neon and lcd screens flashed, and from around corners and behind buildings, the night was illuminated much the same as the day. Cars separated the classes, their horns voices punctuating the streets, as pedestrians in groups loosely scattered the streets, talking and walking on speakerphone. Standing by the metro escalators, there in the square with the overhanging trees of a park, there is construction all around. The buildings seem to be climbing into the darkness at this very moment. Leaving behind and moving forward. We seem to know everything already, our illusion of experience. I imagine taking your hand, I imagined taking your hand, and the lights in the subway flicker as we go deeper. Transit bookmarks each experience, every daydream, and in the end they're interchangeable and indistinguishable between reality and imagination. Try to remember which is real. To Hangzhou the maglev reached 303 km/h, the towering apartment buildings hunch under construction, passing by in blurs on the flat farmland landscape. I fell asleep, as you were dancing but to no music. The lilies on the lake nodded in the rain, dipping into the water. There was a Wal-Mart near the hotel where I won a pink bunny from a claw machine. I remember the beauty of the architecture of Hangzhou station, birds swirling around the pillars near the top, the echoes of the deep station interior, and the laughing at being lost. There at least we have each other, that memory, or that daydream. Everything moves faster than we can control. Days are just flashes, moments are mixed up but burned on film, and all of the places and times are out of order. If it could only be us, only ours. If it was ours, if it was us. Sometimes everything goes faster than you can control and you can't stop, much less understand where you are. I bought a dictionary and phrasebook, but \"xièxie\" was the only word I ever got to use. - Will Long, January 2019” less"

   "name": "Unmissable slab of retro ‘60s/‘70s psychedelia by Cathy Lucas’ Vanishing Twin, featuring Broadcast affiliate Phil MFU, Raime drummer Valantina Magaletti, and Japanese bassist Susumu Mukai paying tribute to bygone times they perceive as more pluralistic, open-ended than music of the modern era... “The anthropologist A. David Napier took aim at one of the most fundamental beliefs of modern times when he wrote his book The Age Of Immunology in 2003. He said the assumption that we can only survive by the elimination of ‘the non-self’ was a central idea which had spread catastrophically outwards from the world of medicine, infecting everything in its path. To Vanishing Twin, one of the most exciting young groups in England at the moment, the term is used in dismay on living through a period where borders are being hardened, walls are being built and new boundaries being needlessly imposed. Band members may come from Belgium, Japan, Italy, France and America but they have all made England their home and, on this album, they are heralds of the much better future that is being rapidly dismantled as we speak. The Age Of Immunology – which is sung in all the primary languages of the musicians who made it as well as English – is the soundtrack for those who still believe in the pluralist dream, where the other is embraced and learned from, not isolated and destroyed. Some of its great power comes from liberation. The album was produced by Lucas in a number of non-standard, non-studio settings. ‘Krk (At Home In Strange Places)’ summons up the spirit of Sun Ra’s Lanquidity and Broadcast And The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio was simply recorded on an iPhone during a live set which crackled with psychic connectivity on the Croatian island of Krk. The magical Morricone-esque lounge of ‘You Are Not an Island’, the blissed-out Jean-Claude Vannier style arrangement of ‘Invisible World’ and burbling sci fi funk ode to a 1972 cult French animation, ‘Planète Sauvage’, were all recorded in nighttime sessions in an abandoned mill in Sudbury. The only two outsiders to work on the recording were ‘6th member’ and engineer Syd Kemp and trusted friend Malcolm Catto, band leader of the spiritual jazz/future funk outfit The Heliocentrics, who mixed seven of the tracks (with Lucas taking care of the other three).” less"

Rhythm & Sound was the project that Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald turned to after their seminal series of recordings as Basic Channel came to an end.

It's perhaps hard to remember over a decade later just how little these productions sounded like anything that preceded them - taking the essence of dub and breaking it down until all that was left was a vapour trail of melody and a colossal bass echo. We could spend an hour listing all the music that basically came along and copied this template in the intervening years but, the thing is, none of what followed comes anywhere near these productions in terms of substance, none of it has aged in the same way. \"Carrier\" was the fifth release on the label and offers another 20 minute trip into the depths of fractured dub. less"

Lowe’s Vancouver show, touring in support of the ‘We Know Each Other Somehow’ album. Sarah brought her Arp Odyssey synthesiser and a looper, and Ariel elected to use his tempura for harmonics, together with a harmonium for drones, plus his keyboard/laptop/Ableton/plugins for effects, and a saxophone for melodies. The results are hard to describe as anything other than richly mystical and intoxicating, with Davachi reaching far beyond what we’ve heard from her before, while simultaneously, and beautifully, tempering Kalma’s energies. Where Kalma reaches for the skies, Sarah’s contributions feel more rooted, and the music they create together comes to inhabit a weightless mid-air of purely “Good Vibes”, in Kalma’s own words. But any verbal description is an afterthought, as the pairing instinctively operate on a non-verbal plane of intuition, with each artist subtly supporting the other’s gestures; whether it’s Sarah underlining Kalma’s flighty sax with undulating drones, or Kalma pulling Sarah’s keening ARP lines into his orbit, their efforts are always harmoniously calibrated. If you’re expecting another achingly quiet Davachi suite, you’ll have to think again.

   "name": "Soul Jazz Records release flautist Lloyd McNeill’s album ‘Treasures’ (1976). Originally issued on the artists’ own private press Baobab label in New York, the album is a serious collectors’ piece, a heavyweight and fascinating fusion of deep and spiritual jazz sensibilities blended with Brazilian and Latin rhythms and melodies. \"Lloyd McNeill is a cultural polymath - a multi-disciplinarian flautist, painter, academic, poet, and photographer - who as a musician has worked with everyone from Mulatu by Picasso!). McNeill grew up during the era of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and his life and work is a reflection of those ideals. All of his music was only ever released on his own private-press record label, echoing the Civil Rights and African-American themes of the era - black economic empowerment and self-sufficiency - and there is a beautiful spirituality in all his music. In the late 1960s McNeill became teacher of both jazz and painting at the New Thing Art and Architecture Center in Washington and in 1969 he was the first African- American professor hired to teach African-American Music History, at Rutgers University. As part of these academic studies McNeill travelled extensively throughout Brazil between 1971-76, studying Afro-Brazilian music. On his first trip to Brazil he met the pianist Dom Salvador, leader of the fusion group Aboliçao and over the next few years worked with many Brazilian musicians including the guitarist Paulinho da Viola, saxophonist Paolo Moura and singer Martinho da Villa. On his return to New York in 1973 he formed a regular and fluid live group that included Brazilian players Dom Salvador, Nana Vasconceles and Portinho as well as many heavyweight jazz musicians such as Ron Carter, Cecil McBee, Marcus Miller, Charlie Rouse, Bob Cranshaw and many more. ‘Treasures’ was the culmination of this intense period for McNeill, fusing Brazilian, jazz and Latin sensibilities together. The album features McNeill on flute, Cecil McBee on bass, Dom Salvador on piano and three percussionists - the Brazilian multiinstrumentalist Portinho, Latin percussionist Ray Armando and jazz drummer Brian Brake. This is the fourth Lloyd McNeill album that Soul Jazz Records have released and follows on from the earlier albums ‘Asha’ (1969), ‘Tanner Suite’ (1969) and ‘Washington Suite’ (1970), all of which are being re-pressed to coincide with this new release.\" less"

Thanks to the timeless cues and intent it was built on, Shedding The Past still sounds amazing today, working to an effortlessly adroit, light-footed and dynamic schematic that makes much of his subsequent work feel a bit clunky and overdone by comparison. On release in 2008, it was a seriously big album for a techno world in flux between classic Detroit house, echoes of UK dubstep, broken beat and Braindance, and traces of tuffer Frankfurt sounds - all components of the Soloaction sound he’d developed for years prior. Fair to say that Shed distilled those styles perfectly in his début album, as proved in its most impressive highlights such as the balletic gait of Another Wedged Chicken, the misty-eyed beauty of The Lower Upside Down and the breakbeat seduction of ITHAW, but most powerfully in its spine-freezing eternal anthem, Estrange.

Following Dome 1’s pretty much unprecedented vacillation of ghostly pop songs and sculpted noise, the duo’s 2nd LP finds them mining deeper into the foundations of avant-rock to coax out strange, plasmic forms of minimalist dirge set to slow, jagged rhythms and lysergic vox. Arriving a year after their first effort, ’2’ documents their further ventures at Eric Radcliffe’s legendary Blackwing Studios (site of seminal recordings by Yazoo and Depeche Mode) after they had spent a lot of intense session reorganising their set-up. The result is an inimitably druggy, enchanted record that slips listeners into a strange state of mind. ‘The Red Tent I’ opens with a gentle transition from the sublime into menacing darkness, while ’The Red Tent II’ follows with a mean pre-echo of sludgy, grungy stoner rock, and ‘Breathsteps’ pushes that vibe down the rabbit hole into a sort of cranky, clangorous free jazz. Side B then opens with the spectral guitar harmonics and distant laughter of ‘Reading Prof. B’, leading into the album’s trippiest pieces with the mogadon rock ’n roll freak ‘Ritual View’ and the psychotomimetic charge of ‘Twist Up’, before it all calves off into the menacing ambience of ‘Keep It’, and we’re left wondering what the eff just occurred. What a deeply strange and wonderful record. less"

   "name": "The gun tune to end all gun tune, ‘The Guncontrolla’ is a righteous pacifist dub statement from the Seekersinternational posse, who go about recording classic firearms being cocked and disassembled with results that land somewhere between Lee Perry's Black Ark, Parmegiani at the GRM and Mark & Moritz at the Rhythm & Sound controls... Armed with a battery-operated 1987 Tascam Porta Two 4-track recorder and a Shure SM57 cardioid microphone, the Seekers capture the disassembly of a Colt British Service Pistol, a Glock 34, a Kalashnikov 1967 Soviet Rifle, and a Springfield M1 Garand, eventually all colliding and grating against one another via an elemental transfiguration coaxed out of the mythical SKRS echo chamber. Drawing on ideas of metaphysics, metallurgy, and telekinetic mysticism, the SKRS treat their subject carefully to avoid any sort of romanticisation or fetishisation of guns or violence - in a temporal warp of dreamlike dread tension, where, crucially, not a single shot is fired. Instead they carefully but ruggedly use dub’s transfigurative techniques to turn the workshop recording into an absorbingly abstract warning shot. The results are fascinating, conjuring some imaginative intersection of a back yard GRM and the Black Ark, and characters from ‘The Harder They Come’ spliced into scenes from ‘Falling Down’, fed thru that psychodelic echo chamber of dematerialised concrète that intends to defuse and diffuse the curse of gun violence with the black magick of dub music. Or, in other words, bullet-time dynamics re-configured as protest dubs. less"

   "name": "Die Schachtel inaugurate the Decay Music imprint for “ambient, ethereal, and emotively abstract” contemporary music with a hitherto unknown hook-up between industrial pioneer Maurizio Bianchi, Saverio Evangelista (Esplendor Geometrico), and Juan Manuel Cidrón Each respected in their niche, the trio converge on a stark and sparse sound woven from lonely solo piano and extra subtle atmospheric disturbances. The two pieces unfold in stately procession with ‘Besoch Trauma’ gathering from streams of sylvan drone, dusky field recordings and looming concrète spectres into a distressed solo piano coda that peals and warbles with aquality recalling Akira Rabelais’ sublime creep. The piece follows thru onto the B-side and into more hauntingly glassy, windswept dimensions, with the keys dropping out to leave us wondering how we got here, sand returning like recollected glimpses in the thick of The Caretaker’s later stages. “Slow, sophisticated, and a deeply meditative, minimalist wonder, Besoch Trauma progresses like a melancholic dream - the slow wilting of sounds, pondering their own rebirth. Repetitive and restrained piano lines rise among drifting synthesiser tones and textural ambiances, fall away and return, fracture, break, stagger, and distort across the entirety of the albums first side, while murky, implacable sounds breed with flirting electronics and piano, sculpting the vast expanse of abstraction which emerges across the entirety of the second - clattering and droning, filled with air, fading melodies, and rippling tones - the inorganic rising as a synthetic vision of the natural world, and a music which entirely refuses to say what it is. Two slow burning sides, unfolding with greater depth at every turn, across Besoch Trauma Bianchi, Evangelista, and Cidrón, joined as Vértice, build rich tapestry of creatively challenging sound - a hypothetical imagining of historic minimalism and ambient music, bred with industrial and punk. Dark, inhabitable, and unquestionably beautiful.” less"

Sublime, late night listening for smoked-out jazz heads and fans of anything from Move D's Conjoint to those excellent first couple of Flanger EP's from Burnt Friedman and Uwe Schmidt. In a further loosening of the jazz screws from their debut album, the group’s frameworks on ‘2’ feel even more open-ended and dynamic this time around. With classic finesse, their Baltimore studio is beautifully applied as an instrument, becoming a primary tool and practically a member of the band, which allows for a frictionless exchange of ideas and energies from the original ‘70s fusion groundbreakers to flow into a lush, hyper-present. In that sense Max D and the central processing unit of Papich, Hyman and Williams play a sort of Teo Macero-like role, acting as a crucial bloc of filters and editors for the players’ dextrous blind takes. With exacting sleight-of-hand executed in both the performance and extended post-production studio techniques, they arrive at gently psychedelic conclusions in seven parts, creating an amorphous sound stage where they project images of a melting 4th world in opener ‘Now More Than Ever’, while Beatrice Dillon’s mouth-watering synth pads and Motion Graphics’ silvery piano bring that halcyon Hassellian feel teasingly close on ‘Mirror In MY Room’, before flirting with the ‘floor on the balmy swing of ‘Rose’, exquisitely lit up with Martin Kasey’s sax and Sami’s spirited flute.

Originally issued by Mille Plateaux in 1998, ‘Königsforst’ is an ideal example of Wolfgang Voigt’s turn away from his early ‘90s acid rave classics toward a more Teutonically-refined hybrid of classical elegance and inexorable techno momentum. More specifically, the tracks distill Voigt’s experience of walking in the Black Forest into a sort of rhythm-driven meditation, creating a space for reflection upon always-the-same/always-different repetition that most beautifully encourages the mind of the listener to wander, ponder and arrive at similarly rarified conclusions.

There were clear hints of this style in the ‘Bande…’ OST, but they most captivatingly come to the fore in this follow-up, most notably on the pulsating brilliance of ‘Versailles… Peut-Être II’ [1977], one of the sharpest pre-echoes of the ‘80s we’ve ever heard, along with the inimitable clarity of his pranging percussion and highly visual editing on ‘Image De Marque I+II’, and the Black MIDI-esque spirals of La Guerre Des Insectes I’ [1980], for example.

   "name": "Akira Rabelais has long been in our list of the most interesting, overlooked producers in electronic music. His early material for Mille Plateaux offshoot Ritornell was nothing short of revelatory, a mysterious, complex maze of elaborate layering that genuinely sounded unlike any of his contemporaries, or anything we've heard since. He was then picked up by David Sylvian's Samadhisound imprint and released an incredible, career-defining head-scratcher of an album in 2004 called \"Spellewauerynsherde' - one of the most spectacularly odd and brilliant electronic records of any description you'll likely hear - seriously - seek it out. Anyhow, that preamble is just to set out the extent to which we're all Rabelais fanboys here - so this new double album, the first disc in collaboration with Harold Budd no less, has arrived here with much excitement, offering his first new recordings in over five years. The Little Glass breaks down clearly over two discs; the first containing four plaintive solo piano parts by Budd and Rabelais, followed by a 2nd disc presenting Rabelais’ hour long, inharmonic, electronic transformation of the preceding material. Rabelais has collaborated with Budd before, he provided his own incredible side-long second CD to Budd's majestic Avalon Sutra album, and while the piano pieces that make up the first CD here are bloody lovely and all, pardon us if we do hurry on to the second disc, because, well, you know this is going to be special. With a deliquescence touch perhaps best compared to William Basinski, the L.A.-based artist renders the original improvisations as a breathtaking hour of glistening tone clusters and mid-air melting partials growing in complexly yet naturally as fractals experienced under the lens of DMT, or a time-lapse image of ice crystals forming at the edge of moving water. To be quite honest, we haven’t the foggiest as to what process that he’s using to achieve these results - it may well be his trusted Argeïphontes Lyre software but, we can’t confirm this - however that matter only ratchets the sensation’s enigmatic appeal - if ever there was a more acute application of the word. It’s the sort of music that gives us involuntary rapid eye movements, as though we’re in sleep mode while awake, making time feel plasmic and space almost tangible in a sense that you could almost huff up his starlight and recline in his hyaline webs. The Little Glass is evidently, achingly, beautiful but, don’t take our word for it; drink deeply and ye shall see, pal. less"

Rhythm & Sound was the project that Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald turned to after their seminal series of recordings as Basic Channel came to an end. From 1997 until 2002 the label released seven 12\" EP's which pretty much defined the direction so much electronic music would turn to in its wake - and it still continues to exert a colossal influence, for better or worse. It's perhaps hard to remember over a decade later just how little these productions sounded like anything that preceded them - taking the essence of dub and breaking it down until all that was left was a vapour trail of melody and a colossal bass echo. We could spend an hour listing all the music that basically came along and copied this template in the intervening years but, the thing is, none of what followed comes anywhere near these productions in terms of substance, none of it has aged in the same way. \"Mango Walk / Mango Drive\" was the second release on the label and, for many, remains its finest moment.

   "name": "Dome’s groundbreaking debut album ‘1’ is finally available as a standalone vinyl reissue via Editions Mego. Comprising Wire’s Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis, Dome formed during Wire’s 1980-84 hiatus, creating their own recording space in Eric Radcliffe’s legendary Blackwing Studios (Depeche Mode, Yazoo), where they would pursue and recombine myriad musical interests to become one of post-punk’s most definitive, influential and endlessly inventive bands. Truly taking to the idea of studio as instrument, Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis used their Dome set-up to generate some of the uncanniest music of their generation. Using the usual guitar and drums, plus synths and lots of tape manipulation, they effectively combined avant-garde experimentation with a pop nous, resulting in strikingly unique songs such as their incredible, signature ‘Cruel When Complete’ featuring the haunting vocals of Angela Conway aka. A.C. Marias, along with oblique noise sculptures such as ‘Ampnoise’ and seminal freaks like ‘Rolling Upon My Day’ which do it all in the space of one track. ‘Dome 1’ was the first of three Dome LPs released on the band’s eponymous label between 1980-81, along with other notables such as the incredible Michael O’Shea album and A.C. Marias’ ‘Drop / So’, which all bore the spooky, spacious hallmarks and air-bending tones of Dome’s studio. It catalogues the first experiments of what, to our mind, was one of the most intriguing and esoteric bodies of work from the early 80’s, combining the artschool sensibilities of Gilbert - who was in his mid '30s by this point - with a post-punk awareness shared by Lewis. They captured the ideal - shared by so many yet achieved by so few - of reaching a kind of avant-pop utopia. 40 years later, it still sounds like nothing else. less"

Brooks, Sadler and Zozula have all been mainstays of the vibrant experimental noise/rock community in the city for several years, having put in time as members of numerous bands including Femmaggots, Harsh Reality, Caymans, Nennen, Wreckage With Stick and Nag – as well as the Misery Loves Company tape label, La Plante collective, and the campus/community radio station CKUT. Lungbutter has been their main jam for a while, playing frequently in Montréal and with sporadic excursions to DIY spaces around eastern North America. Honey is their first full-length album, following the self-released Extractor cassette EP from 2014, which Big Takeover described as “thick neanderthal sludge, stream of consciousness yelps over lawnmower riffs, a dweeb-metal triumph” and Weird Canada praised as “confident, artful, intense”. Lungbutter’s minimal guitar-drums-voice configuration is rooted in a visceral, ascetic punk idiom, refracted variously by free-noise, sludge rock and slowcore. Zozula marshals chaotic motifs of full-spectrum distorto-guitar, occupying a huge tonal space from low-end bass to paint-peeling treble, redolent of blown-out Melvins/Flipper fuzz and equally indebted to the frenetic dissonance of Keiji Haino or Merzbow (as in the thrilling passages of warped noise on “Solar” or “Veneer”). Song structures coalesce around guitar riffs of shifting tempos and the backbone of Sadler’s muscular, deliberate drums, while Brooks’ voice – at once mantric and declarative – deconstructs one brilliant lyrical theme after another, dancing along the knife-edge of dispassionate acerbic examination and wide-eyed cathartic revelation. On Honey, live favourite “Vile” glories in a swampy martial stomp before lifting off into its propulsive, danceable stride. The slow burn of “Intrinsic” finds a doomy three-note pattern of guitar crud and slow, caustic vocal lines to build thick tension, careening towards explosive release punctuated by Brooks’ most impassioned and full-throated shouts. “Honey” and “Veneer” are both marked by guitar intros highlighting Zozula’s marvellously biting tone and technique, with buzzsaw static and freeform noise workouts prefacing the lurch into pounding primeval beats, the likes of which also drive standout tracks “Solar”, “Flat White” and “Dépanneur Sun”. Honey is 33 minutes of satisfyingly searing, sharp-as-tacks, scum-tainted art-rock from one of the city's finest and most uncompromising bands.” less"

On this EP Jon presents 7 tracks of stark, minimal, well-starched, emotionally ambiguous, yet functional techno experiments. Jon is indebted to the no-input mixer experiments of Japanese artists such as Toshimaru Nakamura and Sachiko M, as much he is to techno luminaries such as Jeff Mills and Kotai. He has patiently combined the sounds of malfunctioning circuits with cold acid inflected arps, home recorded analogue drum machines, and classic rhythms.

   "name": "Brooklyn’s superb Blank Form Editions follow peaches by Catherine Christer Hennix and Maryanne Amacher with a first vinyl edition of pioneering free improv jazz rippers from 1975 Japan. Hugely tipped to fans of Sonny Sharrock, Derek Bailey and Keiji Haino! ‘April is the cruellest month’ is taken from 1975 recordings destined for ESP Disk which remained unreleased due to the label’s collapse in 1976. It’s understandably hailed as a missing link between Western jazz and Japanese noise for its joyously unhinged, thrilling levels of abandoned form, and begs the question; how would an international understanding of Japanese noise be altered if it had been issued as and when intended? Until the late ‘60s, Takayanagi, who cut his teeth under Lennie Tristano, was an accomplished player of cool jazz, but his mind was blown by Chicago Transit Authority’s ‘Free Form Guitar’ in 1969 and he turned his back on the Japanese jazz scene, infamously calling them “a bunch of losers” in the music press. Shredding solo, and with saxophonist Kaoru Abe, he would dextrously yet elegantly lay waste to convention and effectively arrive at similar, iconoclastic, and expressive conclusions to the likes of Ornette Coleman, Peter Brötzmann or Derek Bailey at the other ends of the world. In key with the revolutionary spirit of late ‘60s Japan, and the world for that matter, Takayanagi’s shapeshift into “free” zones was cemented with ‘April is the Cruellest Month’, where they inquisitively splay the jazz atom into atonal quarks and bestial chatter in ‘We Have Existed’, and a cranky smear of brass and diffused percussion recalling aspects of Gruppo in ‘What Have We Given?’, before the B-side’s catalcylsmic 20 minute charge ‘My Friend, Blood Shaking My Heart’ truly lets rip with unearthly intensity, Takayanagi’s guitar intrepidly blazing a trail thru the gurning, ecstatic maelstrom in an every-direction-at-once aesthetic that clearly predates Masami Akita aka Merzbow, who wouldn’t debut until 1979, or the Keiji Haino’s Fushitsusha, who emerged in 1978.

   "name": "Mick Harris kicks off his 2019 with this 5 track EP of tar-black, bass heavy sonic violence. \"This EP features 5 reworks of “Salford Priors”, one of the heaviest tracks from his return-to-form album “Over Depth”, the first by Mick Harris himself, and 4 more by his longtime collaborators in the production guises of Fausten, Stormfield, Monster X and Scald Process. The EP begins with an apocalyptic, dubbed out violent reworked by the man himself, creeping in with a cold, calm eerie drone that quickly goes from zero to 100%, blasting into a full force attack of artillery percussion and strafing, shrapnel textures atop the landmine subs and characteristic Harris snarling mono-bass. Julien Caraz has caused much distress over the years with the sheer rage and precision sonic assaults of his Monster X project. Here he eschews his usual frenetic tempos for a solid 130BPM, a sleek techno destroyer built for giant spaces and huge soundsystems in mind. The Combat Recordings boss has worked audiovisually with Mick since the Scorn AV at Bangface Weekend in 2011, toruing with Fret AV in 2018. Here he switches back into audio mode to rework Salford Priors into a hard electro assault for the Stormfield remix. Fausten is the shadowy, twisted collaboration between Monster X and Stormfield. Having released a staggeringly twisted album on the legendary Ad Noiseam, Fausten went into hibernation as the pair pursued their own projects, with only a few sporadic tacks surfacing over the years. The pair have been putting together an album’s worth of new material for 2019, beginning with a powerful remix of Salford Priors. Taking Fret back into it’s aquatic, fathoms-deep sonic territory, this remix is a behemoth work that moves at quarter-step tempo,allowing for more physicality and dynamics, the profound pulse of each profoundly deep bassdrum like an underwater volcanic explosion, with skittering percussion the resonates in the stillness.\" less"

   "name": "Titans of UK rave culture, Fabio & Grooverider look back on ’30 Years of Rage’, their seminal London club night, with the 2nd of four volumes charting the ultra-classic and hard-to-find foundations of hardcore, jungle and D&B - the UK’s greatest gift to the world of the past generation. As the label explain, their RAGE night was arguably the ground zero for Jungle. \"The party was started at London's cavernous Heaven club by Fabio & Grooverider in 1988, at the height of Acid House fever that was making it's way up and down the motorways, slip-roads, fields and warehouses of the M25 and further beyond every weekend, troubling the nation, the police, your parents and the press as it went. RAGE was a different beast, it certainly channelled some of that Acid energy but pitted it against the new and exciting sounds emanating from Belgium, Amsterdam, Detroit, Sheffield, Essex and Hackney and in turn created a new style, a new sonic attitude and energy in the process. Rumbling bass-lines, narcotic synth rushes and roughly chopped and sped-up breakbeats all merged into a style that we now know as Jungle.\" This first volume is a tour de force of early rave pressure, charting a course from Leftfield’s deep 1990 bass massage ‘Not Forgotten’ thru Lennie De Ice’s all-time jungle cornerstone ‘We Are IE’, the London mash-up styles of ‘Dubplate’ by Wots My Code, Foul Play’s artful jungle masterpiece ‘Being With You’, and the bawl fwd hardcore of ‘The Future’ by Noise Factory, saving Fallout’s lip-smacking classic ‘The Morning After (Sunrise Mix)’ for dessert. On volume 2 of 4, ravers are spoilt for choice with a selection running from Derrick May’s metallic Detroit funk in ‘Emanon’ to Q Project’s jungle foundation ‘Champion Sound’, taking in Richie Hawtin’s hoover techno classique ‘Technarchy’ as Cybersonik, Ecstasy Club’s acid house anphem ‘Jesus Loves The Acid’, Nightmares On Wax’s Yorkshire bleep ’n bass staple in ‘Aftermath’, and the deadly feminine pressure of ‘Just 4 U London (Kuff Mix)’ by Bodysnatch.

   "name": "‘Buntús Rince’ translates from Irish as ‘basic rhythms’, and this new compilation explores how Irish musicians were influenced by strands of different genres of music from around the world, merging them to create their own unique sounds. The compilation features some of the most innovative and talented figures in the history of Irish music and includes rare Irish jazz, fusion and folk outliers from the 1970s and early 1980s from musicians relatively unknown outside of Ireland. \"Often regarded as a musical backwater, the 1970s finally saw Ireland begin to make its mark on international music. The nature of this feat is all the more commendable, considering how isolated and conservative the country still was in the middle of the last century. The emergence of acts like Skid Row, Thin Lizzy and Van Morrison instilled in budding young Irish musicians the belief to dream big. Unlike many other European countries, Ireland had not benefited from the cultural impact of immigration. Pioneering Irish musicians did not have access to the type of vibrant music scenes ubiquitous to most European cities at that time. With no talented players or even in some cases recordings of the music, they had to cultivate and invent their own small scenes. A jazz scene had begun to blossom in Dublin in the late 1950s. Self-taught players like Noel Kelehan and Louis Stewart emerged as the Irish standard-bearers. Their level of musicianship saw them play with some of the world’s most renowned artists. The 1960s would see the emergence of the ‘beat’ scene in Ireland, with groups like Granny’s Intentions, Taste and Eire Apparent finally challenging the hegemony of Irish Showbands. Change was in the air. The late 1960s also saw many Irish emigrants returning home, bringing with them inspiration from the new styles and sounds of London and further afield. The arrival in the late 1960s of pirate radio stations like Radio Caroline, new music magazines and the availability of music on vinyl meant that different genres were now becoming more accessible. The musical landscape of the country began to transform and evolve, influencing a new generation of musicians in the process. The 1970s saw advancements in studio technology. 8-track studios began appearing in Dublin, offering more opportunities for groups to record singles and albums. Synthesizers and other instruments were also becoming easier to acquire as the younger generation turned to electric jazz and fusion music. While the level of musicianship was high, the levels of opportunities in Ireland were still very limited. Many groups and solo musicians had to emigrate to try and succeed. Thankfully for those who remained, this new emerging scene didn’t go totally unnoticed and local labels began to take a chance on more obscure Irish groups. Labels like Mulligan and also producers like John D’Ardis and Terri Hooley championed and documented music from the Irish underground of the 1970s. Their valuable work is a common thread which connects many of the tracks on this compilation. From the soaring flute playing of Brian Dunning, to the swinging piano of Noel Kelehan and the sonic force of Jolyon Jackson’s synthesizers; ‘Buntús Rince’ lifts the lid on a vastly underappreciated period of Irish music history. One for the collectors.\" less"

   "name": "In ‘Border Ballads’ Richard Skelton draws inspiration from the rolling landscapes of the Scottish Borders for a moving instrumental panorama coloured with a melancholy palette of piano, bowed cello, viola and burnished electronics. It’s some of the most focussed and direct work of an already fascinating career. Blessed with his usual knack for limning the atmosphere of a place so well it feels familiar even if you’ve never visited it, ‘Border Ballads’ beautifully channels wide open spaces, lush green pastures fringing on moorland, most crucially, experienced without a soul in sight, leaving listeners comfortably isolated in the elements. While there’s no detectable human voices in the recording, Skelton's strings possess the haunting cadence of the region’s rich folk music heritage, which quietly seeps into the album’s abstract yet gripping, underlying narration. \"Richard Skelton has spent the last two years living on the rural northern edge of the Scotland-England border, a boundary demarcated by various watercourses - among them the Kershope Burn, the Liddel Water and the River Esk. This hinterland topography has informed a series of musical recordings which, in their brevity, stand in stark contrast to the longform compositions for which he is more usually known. Nevertheless, there is a sense that these twelve miniatures are fragments of a larger whole, such is their unity in tone and timbre. In some ways, ‘Border Ballads’ can be seen as a revisiting of certain compositional processes first encountered on ‘Marking Time’, over a decade ago. The sparse, overlapping bowed notes, for example, or the solitary, bell-like piano. But there is something different at work here. Whereas ‘Marking Time’ felt aeolian, shifting, fleeting, this new work, with its persistent cello undertow and its low, tremulous viola, feels telluric, grounded, earthen. Perhaps ‘Border Ballads’ can be seen as the embodiment of a desire for certainty after a prolonged period of upheaval, but that ever-close riverine border, at once both fixed and fluid, is a disturbing presence. A darkness that cannot be ignored.\" less"

   "name": "Valerio Tricoli commits his latest electro-acoustic masterpiece to Second Sleep, offering a steeply hypnagogic experience inspired by and employing the Intonarumori (Noisetuners) invented by Futurist pioneer Luigi Russolo. The follow-up to Tricoli’s contemporary concrète classic, Miseri Lares (2014, PAN) keeps with the searching spirit of much great Italian experimental music, with an underlying appreciation of the occult and of mental and physical states undergoing alteration; between waking and dream life and the odd interstices between those dimensions or realities. Vixit quite literally occupies analogue space - 1/4’ tape, analogue synthesisers, home-built instruments - channelling and organising its chaotic uncertainties into something tangibly detailed yet deeply, subconsciously elusive, representing something that exists beyond our peripheral hearing and experience of the everyday. This material may be cleft from Russolo by a century, but, beyond the mere use of of the same instrument, it shares much of a mutual imagination for the abstract, the dreamlike, and the unknown in its surreal arrangements of ephemeral, phantasmic sound sources and aesthetics. The possibilities of the unknown held a great fascination for Russolo which is shared here by Tricoli in a subtle but apparent way that too many artists nowadays seem too cynical towards. The result is a highly absorbing, almost surreal listening experience that comes highly recommended to followers of Tricoli or those of you looking to get lost in a dense and dreamlike soundworld... less"

It’s the year we would have quoted for a sci-fi. Objects Limited have found some music perfect for these times. Let’s introduce Jtamul, a 21-year-old linguistics student and producer who grew up among the woods of North-East Turkey. ‘Lubuni’ reflects those solitudes of being in natural surroundings and of going against societal norms. ‘Lubun’ means queer person in Lubunca, a secret slang that has been used by the LGBTQ community in Turkey. “‘Lubuni’ is the name of that solarpunk fairy princette I’m trying to portray in the EP. I’m trying to open up a virtual space for myself to portray the being I always dreamed to be. A portrayal of myself as a digital fairy princette, who is showing off their vulnerable and tender side as an escape from the strict norms and forms of society that I live in at the time.” Jtamul has brought the future and it is an ocean of tongues, a sweet cacophony of incidental human noises lulling you somewhere into the dreamscape. ’Tsiqvi’ opens ‘Lubuni’ with a throat clearing choir and gentle synth lines swoon the listener, leading into “Bulanik” a track that conjures up imagery of an android learning human speech.” less"

   "name": "Burnt Friedman frames his latest album in the vein of the nonsuch explorer series, with a musical look at Central Europe, specifically Berlin, and its intersection of artists, dancers, musicians still moving to 30 year old techno and house while constantly investigating and discarding novel new forms... “Burnt Friedman with Explorer Series Vol. 4, original ethnic music of the peoples of the world/full spectrum stereo dominance. With such a complicated amalgam of races, religions, and language as there is in central Europe, it is not surprising, that the musical life is endless in variety. Before the upheavals engendered by immigration policies, the introduction of 5 G technology, and the gaining of maximum self-expression, the separation of cultures must have been even more noticeable, yet now in the sphere of music one can see them drawing more closely together. This is especially true of an under-populated melting pot such as Berlin, where the sense of beauty is innate and one hardly meets a white male or a woman not being a painter or a dancer, or a musician. The system of scales, and also the fact that the western central Europeans rely on recorded or written script in order to conserve the themes of their music, could lead us to look upon it as a form of art music. Remarkably enough, traditional house or techno which existed 30 years ago, still flourishes today. Moreover, all the time new forms and musical styles are being discovered, tried out and eventually overlooked. The present record can offer but a modest sampling of extinct splendors, political or individual sufferings, gloomy sadness, love, resentment, exquisite delicacy, laughter and delectable wisdom of rural and urban central European music. Burnt Friedman's essential function is to perform music that ensures the repose of the dead and render their ghosts harmless; in the case of whole communities, to dispel evil spirits and restore to Berlin its pristine purity; and in the case of individuals, to expel the demands of possession. Despite the limited scope of sound carriers, these ten highlights of central European culture contain an emotional force and documentary value of inestimable importance. Although it would be incorrect to consider the various selections contained herein as authentic ethnological documents insofar as the performances were for the most part \"mystified\", on the other hand one can certainly consider them significant examples of the attempts of white males to develop their own modes of expression and communication.” less"

Determined to craft a work of lasting power, Sherwood likens to the album to the work that Rick Rubin did with Johnny Cash on the American Recordings series, a deeply personal work (the album title refers to Lee’s birth name) and arguably the strongest batch of original material that Perry has released for many years. From the atmospheric field recording and wah-wah guitar of album opener “Cricket On The Moon”, to the gothic cello embellishment on “Let It Rain”, the chopped-and-compressed horn section of “Makumba Rock”, to the layered, carefully arranged backing vocals like a heavenly chorus throughout the record, this is an album with true love, care and attention poured into it’s every groove. It culminates in the truly extraordinary “Autobiography Of The Upsetter”, in which Scratch narrates the story of his life from growing up on a plantation in 1930s colonial Jamaica to becoming a worldwide musical superstar. The story of Lee Perry and Adrian Sherwood collaborating stretches back to the mid-1980s, and a fortuitous meeting brokered by underground broadcasting legend Steve Barker between the dub innovator and UK upstart.

On ‘Panama Canal Left-Hand Path’ Dominick Fernow’s Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement locks its attention to “the bloodshed and blind economics of the (panama) canal and its consequences and absurdity, then and now” in one of the project’s finest dispatches since its early days, With uncanny effect the music evokes its subject with soberly transfixing sound design, explicitly taking cues from Basic Channel’s hypnotic bass undulations to highlight and power a series of rotting electro-acoustic soundspheres, never quite fully letting on, but bringing the sense of trudging linearity and humid menace thru suggestive inference. In ‘Hunting Down Individual Mosquitoes’ he evokes the feeling of dread with tense, lurking pads offset by natural bird calls - half sleepy, half acutely focussed - before ‘Isthmus Dark Arts (Electricity Arcs Through Rain)’ brings nightfall with screeching parakeets and a booming heartbeat. ‘Demons Tour The Canal’ then finds the perfect tension between blissed synths and distant, warning rhythms, priming for the extended isolation of ‘The Mountain Didn’t Want’ in two parts. The additional ‘Simulated Thunderstorm’ is Phillipe Hallais’ (Low Jack) seamless 45 minute mix of Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement recordings (same programme plays both sides), originally realised as part of Hospital Productions’ CDMX earthquake benefit.

The latest addition to the musician’s sound palette – the synthesiser. And so a new sound was born, and one which would free pop music from its guitar dominated tradition into something with a bright new future which would write itself. Almost overnight, via a handful of key single releases, the big bang of punk produced something the kids called ‘synth-pop’. The clue was very much in the name. A broad church from the outset, this synth-pop movement wasted no time in embracing players from all corners of the musical dressing up box. From guitar groups drafting in a keyboard playing friend and the progressive rockers using their expensive banks of electronics in new ways to the modernists and the Thatcherists, full of unabashed aspiration, and the punks – arguably the purest punks of them all – who discarded the guitar and the drum kit overnight in their pursuit of something fresh that their generation could truly call their own.

As the label explain, their RAGE night was arguably the ground zero for Jungle. \"The party was started at London's cavernous Heaven club by Fabio & Grooverider in 1988, at the height of Acid House fever that was making it's way up and down the motorways, slip-roads, fields and warehouses of the M25 and further beyond every weekend, troubling the nation, the police, your parents and the press as it went. RAGE was a different beast, it certainly channelled some of that Acid energy but pitted it against the new and exciting sounds emanating from Belgium, Amsterdam, Detroit, Sheffield, Essex and Hackney and in turn created a new style, a new sonic attitude and energy in the process. Rumbling bass-lines, narcotic synth rushes and roughly chopped and sped-up breakbeats all merged into a style that we now know as Jungle.\" On volume 2 of 4, ravers are spoilt for choice with a selection running from Derrick May’s metallic Detroit funk in ‘Emanon’ to Q Project’s jungle foundation ‘Champion Sound’, taking in Richie Hawtin’s hoover techno classique ‘Technarchy’ as Cybersonik, Ecstasy Club’s acid house anphem ‘Jesus Loves The Acid’, Nightmares On Wax’s Yorkshire bleep ’n bass staple in ‘Aftermath’, and the deadly feminine pressure of ‘Just 4 U London (Kuff Mix)’ by Bodysnatch.

   "name": "Nyege Nyege Tapes’ revelatory Singeli series culminates with a rush from scene bossman Mohamed Hamza Ally aka Sisso, whose studio in Dar-Es-Salaam, Tanzania is the epicentre of the world’s most thrilling, punkish new dance style. Arriving after incendiary instalments in 2018 by Bamba Pana, Jay Mitta, and Duke, and the introductory ‘Sounds of Sisso’ compilation in 2017, the ‘Mateso’ album pulls focus back to the scene’s lynchpin with 8 none-more-compelling cuts of breakneck loops and helter skelter riffs on vinyl, supplemented by a tape with equally exhilarating bonus material awaiting quick clickers and dancers. The collected tracks chronicle Sisso’s work over the past four years, spanning a period after his informal studio in the sprawling ghettos of Dar-Es-Salaam grew from a small shack selling DVDs and MP3s, to come to catalyse countless new releases from local producers such as Bamba Pana, DJ Longo, and Balotelli, as well as a wave of new MC’s including Makavelli, Cad Reedah, Anti Virus, Dogo Muchi, Dogo Mjanja, Rehema Tajiri, and Yung Yuda. Sisso’s productions epitomise Singeli’s hyperlocal scenius, distilling the vitality and struggle of life of the fringes of the Swahili-speaking world’s most populous city, into a unique music which seems to reflect the idea of keeping a cool head in frenetic situations. Between his ratchet rhythms and pitched-up melodies there’s a sublime, unresolved tension at play, where the music feels to accelerate so fast that dancers are glyding, sustaining a breathlessly “up” effect that uncannily recalls mid ‘90s UK Happy Hardcore as much as Chicago Footwork, Caribbean Soca and Shangaan electro, yet with a psychotomimetic appeal all of its own. The tracks on ‘Mateso’ are no doubt some of Singeli’s most potently direct and crafty, circling from proper knees-up whirligigs to hyper, laser-riffing funk, ecstatic choral cut-ups and hard but super-sweet steppers that will spark off any up-for-it dance the world over. less"

Highly recommended if yr into Julee Cruise, Arve Henriksen, Múm, Sigur Rós... The co-founder of the Kitchen Motors label with Jóhann Jóhannsson (R.I.P.) and Hilmar Jensson, a onetime collaborator with múm, and an artist behind four solo albums, Kristin brings a fine set of disciplines and a friendly disposition toward collaboration to ‘UNA’, which she offers as a contribution to music as a form of healing, sanctuary or meditation. Improvised at home over the course of a year with friends and lovers, the album is a cycle of soundscapes and mantras based on words from The Foundation for Inner Peace book “A Course in Miracles” (A Miracle is A Shift In Perception From Fear To Love) and the Sanskrit mantra “Samgacchadvam” (Together is A Place), as well as new written text designed as “medicine for the mind.” The combination of music and words relates directly to Kristin’s longstanding practice of yoga and meditation techniques, as she says: “I’ve practiced Yoga and meditation avidly for about 10 years now and so I am well familiar with the practice of using mantras as medicine for the mind and spirit. But finding words outside the traditional arsenal of healing mantras that resonate with me personally was something else and has taken things to a new level.” Guided by intuition, on ‘UNA’ Kira unfurls 6 purposeful mantras for positive imaginations, using little more than vocals, tape loops and space echo to render radiant webs of spectral sound and space that caress the listener in her cat’s cradle. less"

But to be fair, for many, a new MWC release means it’s xmas anyway.

   "name": "Caterina Barbieri somehow recalls both Laurie Spiegel and Lorenzo Senni on her staggering debut album for Editions Mego, with ‘Ecstatic Computation’ yielding her most striking and accessible experiments in pointedly explorative synthesis Working at the point where deep, learned R&D meets sophisticated expression of soul, ‘Ecstatic Computation’ is one of those rare LP's that comes close to divining the ghost in the machine. In further pursuit of the themes underlining Caterina’s ‘Patterns of Consciousness’ [2017] and ‘Born Again In The Voltage’ [2018] records, here she uses more complex sequencing techniques and pattern-based operations to generate the kind of vivid, hallucinatory trance states that many electronic music followers arguably spend their lives seeking. With ‘Ecstatic Computation’ Caterina’s basically mastered the art of extracting a contemplative wonder from her machines, creatively using formal process to manipulate the listener’s temporal and proprioceptive senses, subtly distorting our perception of time and space with spellbinding and psychedelic effect. Most crucially, just like her fellow Italian composer, Lorenzo Senni, Barbieri achieves this effect through minimalist means, with a certain magick lying in the way she allows her machines’ full voice to speak as fluidly as the languages of classical music, but with the immediacy of Trance. From the vertiginous scale and epic breadth of ‘Fantas’, thru the intensely expressive miniature ‘Spine of Desire’, to the balletic agility of ‘Closest Approach to Your Orbit’, Barbieri veritably dances on our nerve endings, before swiftly inverting that headlong futurism with the chamber-like design of ‘Arrows of Time’, featuring vocals by Annie Gårlid (UCC Harlo) and Evelyn Sailor, and wrapping up with the visceral ecstasy of ‘Pinnacles of You’ and a spine-freezing finale ‘Bow of Perception’.

It’s perhaps the most influential album of its era, despite being largely ignored when it was released, going on to set the mould for post and math rock, but also to influence an unfathomable volume of bands in its wake, with its unique take on angular, dynamic production and the perfection of a quiet-loud aesthetic that has loomed large over so much of the scene in the now almost 30 years since its release. With an impact that belies the Kentucky combo's mayfly like existence, Slint set about cherry picking elements from Punk, New Wave and classic Rock then reassembled them so as traditional notions of pitch, rhythm and timbre no longer applied in quite the same. Predicting the Post Rock of Tortoise by almost half a decade, the likes of 'Nosferatu Man' and 'Don, Aman' demonstrate how heavily the likes of Mogwai and godspeed you black emperor! are indebted to their sound.

Highlights include ‘Living On The Ceiling’ (a striking #7 hit in ’82 thanks to its mix of electronics with tabla and sitar), the melancholia of ‘Waves’, ‘Feel Me’s call-and-response electro-funk, the intense ‘I Can’t Explain’ and ‘God’s Kitchen’ which is an early example of Neil Arthur’s gift with images and wordplay. Blancmange’s second album, Mange Tout reached # 8 in the UK charts in 1984 and spawned more hits – notably ‘Blind Vision’ (#10), ‘Don’t Tell Me’ (#8) and their fantastic cover of ABBA’s ‘The Day Before You Came’ (much loved by ABBA who let them use footage from their original video for the Blancmange promo). It signals another change for the band’s music, now increasingly built around deep, propulsive dance grooves. The third and final Blancmange album of the 1980s, Believe You Me was released in 1985 and features bitter-sweet pop songs such as ‘Lose Your Love’, ‘Don’t You Love It All’ and ‘What’s Your Problem.’\" less"

Ultimately the master tapes were lost by Taretone and the album was doomed to obscurity for decades until its recent rediscovery by Tambourine Party Records. Hellfire is both a disco burner and a frantic warning about the impending end of the world.

Recorded in Tokyo and New York City, the album features a superb line up of the best musicians from both cities and sees Yano mixing Japanese pop with funk and a touch of electronics, playing a wide array of keyboards programmed by YMO synth wizard Hideki Matsutake. \"Iroha Ni Konpeitou\" is perhaps Akiko Yano's best known album in the Western world not just because of its striking front cover - a shot by famed photographer Bishin Jumonji featuring Akiko holding an inflatable dolphin (legend has it all the props and clothes were borrowed from the set of an Issey Miyake ad), but because the album is one of Akiko's funkiest ones. A slick mix of Japanese Pop and New York funk, the album was recorded in Tokyo except for the \"Iroha Ni Konpeitou\" title track which was recorded in NYC with an all-star line-up consisting of Rick Marotta, David Spinozza, Will Lee and Nicky Marrero. For the rest of the album, Akiko is accompanied by some of the best musicians from the Tokyo music scene gravitating around the groups Happy End and Tin Pan Alley: the ubiquitous Haruomi Hosono on bass, Tatsuo Hayashi on drums, Shigeru Suzuki on guitar to name just a few. Interestingly two Hosono compositions are featured on the album, \"Ai Ai Gasa\" which he recorded on his 1973 landmark debut \"Hosono House\" and \"Hourou\" originally recorded in 75 by singer and musician Chu Kosaka (on the eponymous album “Horo”). Last but not least Hideki Matsutake is handling the keyboard programming duties on the album as Yano is playing a wide array of keyboards: Moog IIIc, Mini Moog, String Ensemble, on top of the Fender Rhodes, Clavinet, Yamaha CP7C. Matsutake would soon become programmer in chief for YMO, touring and playing with them around the world (like Yano herself). Although the album feels very accessible and funky, there are complex keyboard layers underneath as on the first short introduction 'KAWAJI', a short electro fantasy, or on such tracks as \"Ai Ai Gasa\" and “Kino Wa Mou\" on which Akiko is playing bass with her Moog, making the album a richly textured and inventive one once you scratch its surface. The tracks on the album flow effortlessly also highlighting Akiko Yano's superb songwriting and knack for creating fascinating pop song. \"Iroha Ni Konpeitou\" sounds as fresh and beautiful as when it first came out more than forty years ago and will please the growing circle of Akiko Yano fans around the world as a welcome addition to her brilliant discography.\" less"

   "name": "Sam Annand (fka Architeq) makes canny use of a disused grain silo’s 36.5” reverb time as part of a project highlighting and experimenting with uniquely reverberant spaces around Scotland. Using a mixture of Modular synth systems, a Roland Juno-6, drum cymbal, and an array of hi-end mics and speakers, the recordings in ‘Saturday 21 May 2016’ render a richly sonorous reading of the silo’s architecture and the space’s inherent soul, with colourfully sweet synth tones connoting its original function, to store sugar beet in the ‘60s, and though to starker, isolated tones and patterns that perhaps speak to the concrete building’s isolation ever since, stranded unused in Fife, eastern Scotland. “In 2014, the Resono project was set up to study a number of highly reverberant locations around Scotland, with the aim of exploring and experimenting with the sonic qualities and possibilities offered by each. Research for the project took place in spaces including a water reservoir, giant sea caves, oil storage facilities, an abandoned munitions factory, an early 19th century ice house and a cathedral. Among them was a 200 feet tall disused concrete silo, built in 1964 by the British Sugar Corporation to store sugar beet, but abandoned just eight years later. With the exception of a brief revival in the early 2000s for grain storage, the structure has remained empty. The extreme acoustics exhibited by Cupar Grain Silo are an accidental artefact of it’s ambitious industrial architecture, with a reverberation time approximating 36.5 seconds. Using impulse responses made within the structure, bespoke music was produced, sympathetic to these acoustics. These compositions were then reamplified back into the space in front of a live audience on Saturday 21 May 2016.” less"

Made using a Roland MSQ700 sequencer in real time with multiple MIDI synths and modules, Wøllo’s music inside ‘Sources (Early Works 1986-1992)’ was written off the cuff and never really intended for release. Now 27 years later, it will surely appeal to a generation nurtured on synth music, taking in 10 magnificent, icy vistas that sound like pre-echoes of music to come from Biosphere and Arve Henriksen. \"Wøllo, who has been a professional artist since 1980, has covered a wide range of styles, from rock and jazz to experimental electronic and classical music. He was one of the first Norwegian composers who adapted a minimalistic style, building a bridge between grand symphonic realms and gentle, serene sounds. His musical statements range from slowly-drifting kaleidoscopic passages to epic soaring guitar melancholy, to upbeat ever-changing sequences and compelling melodies. Possessing a sense of drama and storytelling, Wøllo has been composing and performing music for films, theatre, ballets, and art exhibitions. As well as music for string quartets and large orchestras. He has collaborated with some of the most respected artists in the ambient music world: Steve Roach, Ian Boddy, Byron Metcalf, Bernhard Wöstheinrich, amongst others. Sources joins Wøllo’s nearly 40-album catalogue. Comprised of 10 previously unreleased tracks, Sources was originally recorded surrounding the album sessions that spun Dreams Of Pyramids(1984), Traces (1985), and Silver Beach (1986). This was the start of a very fruitful and inspired period for Wøllo, thanks to modernized technology like MIDI and inspiration from music from all over the globe. “There was lots of new equipment coming out during these years, and this reflects the music I made at the time.” Wøllo says. “There was also a lot of great electronic music released. I was inspired by artists like Hassell, Eno and Budd. Also a big influence was Klaus Schulze after seeing him at the legendary Oslo club, Club 7 in 1984.” The spacey sounds on Sources show a clear line of cosmic excursions between Wøllo’s early releases to modern day fellow Norwegian travellers Lindstrøm, Bjørn Torske, and Prins Thomas. Sources remained untouched, transferred from tapes that Wøllo had made years ago, before Helge Sten (Deathprod) mastered the material in his Audio Virus Lab. The collection was mostly created with a Roland MSQ 700 sequencer, in real time with several MIDI synths/modules recorded directly to either a 2-track stereo recorder or 4-track Tascam Portastudio.\" less"

Titled after the Disney adaptation of 'Paese dei balocchi' (or the Land of Toys) in Carlo Collodi's 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' (1883), 'Pleasure Island' is a metaphysical playground of organic and digital cohabitation, its inhabitants pacified by toys and comforts. Alongside Dawn Bothwell, Suze Whaites, Laurie Tompkins, and Francesca Fargion, Parkinson exerts an uncannily emotional pull from an unlikely but potent alliance of ultra-minimal aesthetics, dead-beat drums, junk electronics, and mechanised mantras. Voices are hemmed in by electronic sound. People buffeted around by machines. Words surrounded by garlands of digital interference. Time repackaged as countdown.

   "name": "Yeah that's what we’re talking about; supremely dank, occult dark ambient and submerged black metal atmospheres from Jim Mroz aka Lussuria, properly harrowing recordings pierced by occasional shafts of blinding light and choral arrangements that take us to exceptionally weird places. Huge recommendation If you’re into anything from Hildur Guðnadóttir’s isolationist soundscapes to Kevin Drumm or Thomas Köner's frostbitten classics. On the foreboding ‘Three Knocks’ Lussuria limns an unconscious, near-death experience based on a tale told by his grandmother, who was admitted to ER after an allergic reaction escalated into something inexplicable. She was put in a medically induced coma and administered a breathing tube. When under the effect of heavy sedatives, she spoke of a visit by angels who warned of an impending disaster. She eventually came around, and recounted that her illness was preceded by three knocks at her office door, slow and heavy - proposing that each knock was a mockery of the Holy Trinity; one knock for each crucifixion - but when she answered nobody was there. This omen, and its confirmatory hallucination form the basis of Lussuria’s utterly absorbing new album. Using a Hawaiian flute made from a human femur, and an Iron Lung for percussion (don’t ask how he accessed it), together with operatic tape cut-ups and field recording made on the shores of Long Island’s empty asylums, Lussuria stages his grandmother’s vision in four parts of lugubrious, black metal ambient gloom. The atmosphere is just frighteningly tangible, revealing a sense of depth perception and stone cold clamminess that brings its spirit vividly within touching distance, from the over-the-shoulder vocals and cracked window pane howl of ‘Fentanyl Chaser’, to the hollow clank of oil drums and spent ammo casings in ‘Three Knocks’, and through to the frankly terrifying descent thru choral loops into a bony flute solo with ‘Confused And Ill By Shadows’. This would all just be another urban myth were it not for the exquisite detail and dramaturgy of Lussuria’s production and arrangement, which typically imparts its feeling in no uncertain terms, most acutely hyperstizing (making a superstition real) a state of psychological dread and panic induced by the occult imagination. less"

Bringing the vibe up from the belly to head-thizzing effect with the filter-funk of ‘Find You’, his sample-hunting skills are in sterling effect across the EP, most poignantly in the pitched-up, Gary-jawed tremble and smooth Reese bass rolige of ‘Friends & Lovers’, and with slamming friday night Northern Soul buzz in ‘I Know, I Know’, while his title track tends to your tail feather with infectious swing, and ‘You’re Fine’ brings the EP, and this current phase of Finn’s production to a close with perfect measure of warm nostalgia and gently insistent, PLUR positivity that, quite crucially, doesn’t feel heavy-handed or overwrought, just right. less"

Written over 4 years it marks a return to song-writing for the duo, employing fever-dream melodies and synth drunk hooks, balanced against off-kilter production that sets them apart from their peers. Intense, impassioned, guttural yet enigmatic - the album documents the process of leaving London and the empowerment a new life inspires. The opening & title track is a statement of intent “are you aware of my power?” repeats Garza, leaving us in no doubt that we really shouldn’t doubt her. Tone set, what follows is gloriously idiosyncratic and deeply personal pop, presented without compromise or concession. Direct, confident, articulate - gone are the the opiated improvisations of 2017’s \"The Silent Season\", though the wilful sense of adventure remains throughout. \"Our Love is The Gold\" is a record of awakenings and self-discovery.” less"

As the Parisians’ first collaboration, ‘Mirages’ finds Fitoussi and Dunckel curving away from prior, respective solo vectors into meditative synth music and meticulous synth-pop to arrive at a mutual conclusion of softly-played, star-eyed electronics realised between Xavier Veilhan’s Studio Venezia - the French Pavilion during the 2017 Vencie Biennale - and Studio Atlas at home in Paris. One for country day-tripping in the sun, as well as watching the stars come out at night, ‘Mirages’ works its magick with all the slow subtlety one might imagine from a member of AIR, while Fitoussi’s avant-experimental leanings lend it a more inventive, spaced-out breeze of lush, lysergic possibility and vulnerability. “Synthesizers amassed through the years, which on this album, conceived with precision and care over the course of one year, reveal their essence – and more importantly, their soul, going from very cinematographic parts to very direct others. Between start and finish, a singular floating and inventive pop music unfolds. An upgraded form of instrumental electronic music, that takes the listener very far, and very high, perfectly mixing both musicians world, like fruitful pictures arisen from a desert that forgot to be arid.

   "name": "A synth-pop zinger from 1984 Slovenia pipes up on necessary reissue from Rush Hour. While little known outside of the former Yugoslavia, Videosex’s self-titled debut album from 1984 sold in significant numbers, making superstars of the young Slovenian musicians responsible for making it. The set not only helped turn Yugoslavian teenagers on to the possibilities of Western-style electronic pop, but also inspired them via satirical, often explicit lyrics. Revolving often satirical lyrical content about erotica, lesbianism, voyeurism and sadism, set to some of the poppiest production you’ve ever heard, it’s perhaps no wonder that the original pressing was a massive seller in the former Yugoslavian country. After being signed following a performance at Novi Rock festival in Ljubljana, the band spent over 200 hours in the studio exacting their diamond cut sound, resulting super punchy, sprung machine rhythms, glittering synths and ohrwurming vocals, which, while sung in their native tongue, surely and playfully connote all the lascivious content of the lyrics to all listeners. A pretty much flawless gem. less"

   "name": "Alex Zhang Hungtai takes his instrumental work to ever more personal and moving levels on his soundtrack to a semi-autobiographical film meditating on the meaning of home in which Hungtai himself plays the main protagonist, returning to Hawaii to trace his roots. It arrives in the wake of some of his most significant artistic achievements; the stunning ‘Divine Weight’ album which knocked us off our feet in 2018, that incredible Love Theme album for Alter, and his appearance under the spotlights of The Roadhouse stage in Twin Peaks Season 3 as one half of house band Trouble alongside David Lynch’s son Riley. Hungtai has captivated us since he emerged from Montreal’s burgeoning music scene at the early 2010’s as Dirty Beaches, and his movements since have taken turns that have been both unexpected and entirely in keeping with his unique aesthetic approach, pushing ever further into the rawly expressive style that has earned him cult-like status over the course of the past decade. August At Akiko’s is in some respects his most unvarnished and personal work to date - infused with location recordings made in Hawaii, the music reflects the serene, introspective ambience of the film itself. Opening with the short, naked field recording of ‘Temple Bell’, and resolving with the harmonious glow and dissonant shards of keys in ‘Ocean Boy’, the soundtrack is dominated by two contrasting tracts featuring Hungtai on his favoured sax. The first, ‘Sky Burial’ is a starkly brooding piece opening with a menacing rumble and clatter of ceremonial Buddhist music where he joins in, tentatively at first, but growing into a ripping display of wounded beast bleats and whirling shreds as febrile and roving as the background drums. In sharp contrast, the flipside is free of drums, leaving Hungtai blowing beautifully blue whims to himself. Unadorned and as vulnerable as could be, the side ends with a meditative solo piano piece which acts as a perfect distillation of the stillness and inner peace the film manages to capture so well, living in the seams between dreams, reality, and memory, with a temporality all of its own. Stunning. less"

Smith, The Fall formed in Manchester in 1976 and were one of the most prominent post-punk groups in the world. Musically, there may have been several stylistic changes over the years, but it was often characterised by an abrasive guitar-driven sound and frequent use of repetition, always underpinned by Smith's distinctive vocals and often cryptic lyrics. “They are always different; they are always the same...” John Peel “Dragnet” is the second studio album – released 26th October 1979 - these editions celebrate the fortieth anniversary of this seminal album. Originally released through record label Step-Forward, it predicated 2 major factors in the group’s career – high productivity and high group turnover.

A solid state which is simultaneously and continuously changing.” Echoing the stripped down approach of Yves De Mey’s recent ace ‘Exit Strategies Part 1’, the results are all dead abstract, and range from what sounds like a protein-gargling alien vocaloid in his ‘Holy Whisper’ parts, thru to bouts of ultra iridescent, deliquescent, gurning lushness in the ‘Fluid Noise’ bits, and a couple of astringent, unsettling ‘Cleaning’ numbers. less"

Compiling Emily’s two self-released tapes ‘Water Memory’ [2017] and ‘Mount Vision’ [2018], this sublime package brings us right up to date with her effortlessly enchanting solo output. Across 14 parts in 80 minutes, she proves equally adept at sprawling out in longer forms, as with ‘At Lake’, as she is at capturing crystalline vignettes like the kaleidoscopic miniature ‘Huckleberry’, or the microtonal peal of ’Synth 3’, all pointing to a charming new talent coming into being. “Emily A. Sprague’s Water Memory and Mount Vision albums are presented in new and complete detail. Emily’s work concerns the connectedness of all things, giving living, core form to the mysterious forces that guide earthly activity and human contact with them. Memory and vision, ocean and mountains, question and answer, emotions and infinity. Sunshine, lizard, sea salt. Through sound and poetry, Emily focuses on fleeting moments of crystalline clarity and meditates on expanded lifetimes of intricate meaning-making. This vision is unfalteringly beautiful, gently profound. But, as Ursula K. Le Guin intuits in her translation of the Tao Te Ching, “In poetry, beauty is no ornament; it is the meaning. It is the truth.” A collection of reflections are visible in the mirrored structures of Water Memory and Mount Vision, two chapters - two halves - each complemented by a written verse. As much about the presence in youthful experimentation as the permanence of transition and maturation, Water Memory is the first long-form instrumental music Emily ever channeled, generated over a year of self and sonic exploration between Massachusetts and New York.” less"

   "name": "Exquisite shadowplay of electro-acoustic, midnight jazz, and cinematic synth tropes from James Rushford, peer and collaborator of Oren Ambarchi, Klaus Lang and many more - RIYL Jakub Ullmann, Deathprod, Felicia Atkinson “This LP is Rushford's first solo release in a decade and the very first he has composed, performed, and recorded entirely alone. Primarily recorded in Los Angeles in 2017, The Body's Night is a single electro-acoustic suite stretching over thirty minutes, utilizing field recordings, flutes, ocarina, microphones, organ, percussion, piano, tape, analog synthesizers, viola, and voice. True to its title, the record immediately ushers into a nocturnal, intimate, claustrophobic space where the hyper-amplified rustle of clothing and vocal mumbles are shadowed by uneasy synth tones, fluttering white noise and distant filigrees of ultra-high-pitched tones at the edges of aural perception. While the influence of contemporary composers such as Klaus Lang and Jakob Ullmann (both of whose music Rushford has performed extensively) makes itself felt in the music's attention to the liminal space between sounds, Rushford also draws on the bedroom synth explorations of '80s acts like Déficit Des Années Antérieures (DDAA) and the harmonies and production values of black metal, drawing a common thread between these influences in terms of their shared interest in atmosphere and deliberate retreat from perspicuity. Relief from this claustrophobic atmosphere comes through the episodic structure of the piece, where like an already dark shot fading to black, each sequence retreats from your ears before you can properly grasp it. Rushford uses classical electro-acoustic techniques and plays elegantly on the fundamental ambiguity of the acousmatic situation in which you can never be sure of the source of the sound you are hearing. But rather than a tribute to the masterworks of musique concrete, this is defiantly idiosyncratic and personal music. Meticulous in production values and exploratory in timbre, tonality and form, The Body's Night is a key work from one of the most singular young composers at work today. Stunning artwork by O.B. De Alessi. Design by Lasse Marhaug. Mastered and cut at 45rpm for maximum fidelity by Rashad Becker at Dubplates & Mastering, Berlin.” less"

   "name": "So you’ve heard a billion and one 4th world types emulate Afro-New Age styles, now here’s the real thing from Justus Nnakwe aka Jay U Experience, a Nigerian artist recording in NYC, 1993. This is a total pearl, we tell thee. Uprooted by the excellent Left Ear Records after recent Soundway and Now-Again reissues of Nnakwe’s late ‘70s psych-rock jaunts with People Rock Outfit and The Hygrades, the ‘Abuja EP’ catches him years later formulating glittering rhythmelodies and saucy basslines on synths and drum machines, channelling the charms of his early work into a whole new paradigm. The results are totally primed to dovetail with LER’s expanding international roster of oddities. On the A-side the promise of ‘Back To Motherland’ harmonises glyding pads and warm FM bass with lilting melodic percussion in creamiest style, and ‘Ancestral Call’ follows with delicious flutter of tuned drums and natty brassy melody that feels so much more effortless than the genre’s more cod pieces. The B-side sustains the charm with breezing chime trees and syn-flutes synched to grunky acidic bass in glyphic flow on ‘Okokobioko’, and ‘Abuja’ saves a twist in the tale to tread a fine line between pensive darkness and utopian new age feels.

Over thirteen minutes of crisp, stratospheric elegance, Holden’s rework is both slightly mad and simultaneously blissful – like a trance-state reached through frenzied, spiritual ritual. “I believe in serendipity: if the universe presents you with something that seems right, you should go with it”, says Holden. “When this record hit my desk was one of those moments. Recently I'd been thinking a lot about rave utopias, the pan-global fantasy painted by the early days of Future Sound Of London etc, and listening to LSOS's Jodorowskian ceremonials I felt like they'd caught the same winds.

Motionless is Cold Showers looking inward and taking control of their creative process, while retaining all of their unique songwriting signatures. Recorded in their own studio in Los Angeles with band member Chris King at the production helm, each selection on Motionless sounds like a line drawing that quickly becomes a technicolor collage of crashing shoegazed reverberation. As compared to their previous endeavor, Matter of Choice, the similar additions of arpeggiated electronics and more recently, string arrangements, adds a new, more sophisticated depth to Cold Showers’ already dense allegories. Tracks such as “Shine” and “Faith” stand on their own as heavy-hearted melodies that have an almost “classic” impression after only one listen. The band’s cover of Sandy Rogers’ 80’s ballad “Black Sidewalk” (only available on the LP & CD) offers proof-of-concept, never fully comfortable with their formula and challenging themselves as to what defines an amazing song. “Measured Man” and “Dismiss” have Cold Showers orbiting in the palpitations of early Factory Records and present each spin with tactical layering, rather than flooding the board. \" less"

   "name": "The first compilation to be released on the PAN label, Mono No Aware collates unreleased ambient tracks from both new and existing PAN artists including Yves Tumor, M.E.S.H., Pan Daijing, Sky H1, AYYA, Jeff Witscher, Helm, TCF, HVAD, Kareem Lotfy, ADR, Mya Gomez, James K, Oli XL, Flora Yin-Wong, Malibu, and label head Bill Kouligas, moving through more traditional notions of what's considered ’Ambient’, to wider variations that fall under the term. It’s an incredibly coherent suite of tracks that quite honestly sounds like the work of a singular, multi-facted artist rather than a disparate collection of pieces, something that’s perhaps testament to Bill Kouligas’ exceptional curation skills. While the album revolves around central themes of “an empathy towards things” or “a sensitivity to ephemera”, in practice it serves to beautifully illustrate the label’s depths in unity and common purpose with tracks by key roster - M E S H, Bill Kouligas, Sky H1, Helm, Yves Tumor, Jeff Witscher (Rene Hell) - as well as a smart influx of extended family and new producers - TCF, AYYA, Flora Yin-Wong, HVAD & Pan Daijing, Kareem Lofty, Malibu, Oli XL - who refresh and perfectly expand the label’s already unfathomable breadth of styles, personnel and their perspectives. It’s also by some distance the label’s most sublime release, shifting thru 16 subtly personalised and compatible pieces, with results that speak to a world of increasingly chaotic flux and instability by simultaneously mirroring its confusion while also providing an inclusive safe space away from it; offering mutual gridwork for a spectrum of expressive nuance that takes in the billowing lushness of Egyptian artist Kareem Lofty’s Fr3sh at one end, and the colder digital soul of Danish/Chinese duo HVAD & Pan Daijing at the other. In the space between, Mono No Aware transcends vast, ostensibly detached time and space between Polish producer AYYA’s exquisite Second Mistake and Yves Tumor’s elusive/illusive Limerence to highlight their differences and similarities, vacillating the windswept dynamics of Helm’s Eliminator with ADR’s ambient-pop hymn Open Invitation and jumping from the needling peak of Mya Gomez’s justforu to Bill’s own ambiguous blend of agitated noise and aching melancholy in the rare outing, VXOMEG and in a tormented but optimistic way mutual to the M E S H and Sky H1 cuts and especially TCF’s C6 81 56. On one level Mono No Aware helps to rescue ambient music from the clutches of neo-classical bores, and on another helps to firmly place it within context of the modern world. It’s a brilliantly curated, hugely satisfying collection of tracks from a label that never seems to rest on its laurels. less"

   "name": "Sarah Davachi serves her 2nd album of 2018 with ‘Gave In Rest’, offering a studio developed follow-up to her mesmerising album ‘Let Night Come On Bells End The Day’, which has quietly dominated our listening lives for months already... As her beatific blends of early church, medieval and Renaissance musics have patiently and patently revealed over the past five years, Sarah’s works for piano, organ, synth, and woodwind demonstrate a unique gift for extracting and reworking the most affective spirits of church music to a secular appeal, effectively voicing a sort of metaphysical minimalism that could be explained as a result of deeply focused technique, but is perhaps better regarded as a timeless form of sonic alchemy. Where her previous records were documents of a shorter time spent with her instruments, Sarah dedicated herself on ‘Gave In Rest’, spending a summer giving deeper consideration to how Renaissance musicians experimented with new instruments, forms and texture, and “how the quietude… and the openness of physical space, the stillness of altars“ in churches would have affected how they wrote. Subsequently recording with Howard Bilerman at Montreal’s hotel2tango (home of myriad, seminal Constellation recordings), Sarah brought those instrumental ideas to life with the modern addition of tape delays and chorusing effects to infuse and render shimmering new layers of timbral depth to her plaintive melodic gestures, and with a subtle yet unmistakably visceral impact. In album opener ‘Auster’ she uses tape to slow down a recorder and open up its vibrating innards, revealing a tremulous, transfixing soul in the most humble of instruments, while the LP’s closer ‘Waking’ finds her locating elusive echoes of Baroque harmonies in that most soulful machine, beautifully realigning its putative purpose. In between, her tracks’ moods and titles chart a slow passing of day and night, from he ghostly elegance of ‘Third Hour’ to her sylvan ‘Evensong’, thru to the stately yet lip-wobbling beauty of ‘Matins’ at the album’s core, and perhaps best of all in the achingly evocative coruscation of ‘Gloaming’, a song we already know we’ll be returning to for many, many years to come. The loaded, polysemous word ‘soul’ springs to mind, on the one hand connoting lofty notions of transcendence, contemplation and reverence, while on the other also helping to define a gentle, slow-burning modesty and broad appeal to practically anybody with ears and a functioning sense of empathy. But most of all, ‘Gave In Rest’ will strike a chord with anyone who listens properly and attentively. To use another loaded phrase, the devil is beautifully apparent in its gilded detail. less"

   "name": "Oren Ambarchi’s Black Truffle label rustles up a reissue of this absolute classic, Annea Lockwood’s 1970 tape piece Tiger Balm - unavailable on vinyl for over thirty years. The LP also includes a pair of unreleased pieces; the vocal and percussion study Amazonia Dreaming, and the beautifully suspenseful microtonal electro-acoustic levitation, Immersion. Breaking entirely with the dynamic language of musique concrète, Lockwood used a select palette of mainly unprocessed sonic elements chosen for their mysterious and erotic characteristics to open a space of dream logic and mysterious associations between nature and culture, the ancient and the modern. “\"Created while Lockwood was living in the UK, the side-long 'Tiger Balm' is a singular work within the cannon of tape music. Inspired by research into the ritual function of music, the piece explores the possibility of evoking ancient communal memories through sound. These unusual and evocative field recordings (a purring cat, a heartbeat, gongs, slowed down jaw harp, a tiger, a woman's breath, a plane passing overhead), presented as no more than two sounds at once, allowed one to flow organically into the next, their shared characteristics highlighted, opening a space of dream logic and mysterious associations. The B side presents two pieces for percussion available here for the first time. 'Amazonia Dreaming' (1987), performed by Dominic Donato, uses unaccompanied snare drum and voice to evoke the nocturnal soundscape of the Amazon rainforest. Unorthodox techniques and materials (marbles, chopsticks, a plastic jar lid) transform the snare into a resonant field of sensual textures. 'Immersion' (1998), performed by Donato and Frank Cassara, is a slow-moving exploration of gentle beating tones, performed on marimba, tam tams, and gong. Like the other two works presented on this LP, it provides captivating proof of Lockwood's belief in the complexity that deep listening can reveal within seemingly simple sounds.\" --Francis Plagne less"

Pure sensory overload this one, and that’s LFO-K by us. ‘Some Kind of Threat’ takes the slow burn approach and arrives at a similar destination, resulting in a cyborg techno stomper that’s as hot and humid as the rainforest canopy. Situated between these two dance floor behemoths, ‘Primary Function’ acts as something of a palette cleanser, recalling a dubbed-out Boards of Canada on a particularly warped mushroom trip. Closing things out in style, ‘Akathisia’ is as restless and jittery as its name suggests, alternating between eski synth outbursts and a bouncy fairground beat. Timothy’s music has brought us many special moments over the past few summers and seems bound to do so again, with the new EP already getting played by the likes of Optimo, Lena Willikens and Andrew Weatherall, who memorably melted the crowd’s collective brain when he dropped Clerkin’s ‘Divisive’ at Houghton last year. After cutting his teeth as one half of Eskimo Twins, Timothy launched his solo career in 2014 under the now-retired Heretic moniker. Having released on labels including Throne of Blood, Hard Fist and Tusk Wax, he’s now graduated to running his own Insult To Injury imprint from his new base in the Netherlands.

   "name": "DFA give room for Giegling’s Edward to stretch his mind and your legs, melting out in the 12 minute cosmic pool of ‘The Lagoon’, then getting down to lysergic tribal functions with the trampling ‘Mental Drive’ “On his DFA debut, German experimental techno producer Edward largely departs from the 4/4 grid he frequents and blurs the focus towards a more slippery, improvisational vibe. Fans of his Desert Sky alias, as well as his work reshaping classic tracks by Harmonia & Eno and Rolf Trostel of Tangerine Dream, will be quite pleased with Underwater Jams. These two new songs unfold at their leisure, going off on whizzing, kosmiche-influenced tangents, all the while guided by the hand drums of percussionist Geronimo Dehler. On A-side “The Lagoon,” the freedom of the long-form composition allows Edward to go deeper and more mesmeric, while the restrained stomp of B-side “Mental Dive” allows for an introspective dance floor moment. Though he’s been releasing music for the past decade, Edward has always been a bit enigmatic, with a majority of his discography only available on vinyl. He remains as prolific as ever – in the last year alone, Edward has toured all over the world, playing esteemed clubs from Berghain to Fabric, and splitting bills with artists like Ricardo Villalobos and Oskar Offermann. His numerous releases on Giegling, Die Orakel, and White demonstrate his penchant for combining the psychedelic and the locked-in groove, but it’s the sprawling sense of adventure that makes this release one of the more idiosyncratic in Edward’s catalog.” less"

I was lucky when I looked in the local music ads that I to find Gabriel Farm Studios inPrinceton,New Jerseyowned and operated by Andy Gomory. Andy was a true talent, a keyboardist and arranger, we hit it off immediately. After he recorded my mixes we would record songs together. Andy played drum machines and keyboards while I played percussion, keyboards, & guitar and we both sang. When Andy and I parted ways in the late 1980's I decided to add both drums and percussion as well as overdubs from guest musicians many of which are included on this album. The albums timeframe ends in the year 2004. The later recordings have a jazz feel to it yet still had dance music elements mixed in. The title track \"Primitive Substance\" really sets the tone as you hear the great playing of Michael Gribbrook on Frugel horn/Trumpet and Gerry Carboy on bass. Also, my favorite song on the recording \"Forgiveness\" has David Axelrod (not the famous one) playing beautiful melodic bass guitar thru out.

Having previously released a limited edition cassette tape in 2016 under the name of ALN, their self-titled album for Hallow Ground is to be considered the three-piece’s definite studio debut as This Is Where. Recorded and mixed by Kizys, »This Is Where« delves even deeper into the psychedelic and at times cosmic drone sound previously to be heard in the New York City-based trio’s live recordings. As a logical next step after what the Swans guitarist Westberg has presented on recent solo albums like »The All Most Quiet« for Hallow Ground, it integrates three distinct musical visions into a whirling ocean of sound. This Is Where's sound is neither dominated by the thundering brutalism of Swans - where also Kizys took over bass duties for a while - nor the gloomy Doom Pop of Wright’s Bee and Flower. Instead Kizys, Westberg and Wright use delay, reverb and effects to weave a pulsating web of sonic textures, moving effortlessly from dark depths to almost jubilant high notes. With Kizy’s roaring bass guitar as a sonic backdrop, Westberg and Wright give rise to a musical dialogue marked by density and tension. Over the course of 40 minutes, This Is Where create a mesmerising musical experience, divided into four discrete movements. »This Is Where« is a blissful journey through space, time and most of all a yet unheard-of approach to guitar-driven Drone and Ambient music.” less"

Luka’s 3rd release for Sahel Sounds follows the quietly stunning ‘Fasokan’ album with blend of that album’s balmier moments and the African pop and rap styles on his debut ‘Mali Kady’ tape, offering a much wider testament to the breadth and sweetness of his sound. Meshing live traditional strings and flutes with synths and software percussion, plus myriad vocals, ‘Falaw’ fully spells out Luka Productions’ style, drifting from the title track’s languorous folk soul at one end, to the driving, UKF-compatible banger ‘Dogonodoon’ (note the reference to the enigmatic Dogon tribe) at the other, taking in a very healthy set of dance trax such as the reggaeton-like ‘Bbni’, the charming twang of Sitars on a disco beat on ‘Indienfoli’, and the devilish twyst of ‘Badjan’ alongside more fragrant, spacious and unexacting downbeat highlights in the grubbing sway of ‘Forêt’, and something very close to the ‘Fasokan’ sound with ‘A Tara’, where he gently flanges Kora strings under his hushed vocals to gorgeous, spine-playing effect.

   "name": "Dylan Carlson and Adrienne Davies return Earth to its fundamental state - raw, slow burning and sensually psychedelic - in the “witches garden” of ‘Full Upon Her Burning Lips?’, their 9th studio album marking 30 years since the band’s formation Doing away with the increased polish of Earth’s albums since they returned with 2005’s ‘Hex; Or Printing In The Infernal Method’, the singular band now prize a more direct route to the core of their sound. Still geologic in pace, their 1000 yard stare is here as transfixing and strung out as their early “ambient metal” classics, but of course with the addition of Adrienne’s workhorse drums underlining and urging Carlson to drag every riff out to the horizon. The album’s 10 songs are titled with reference to historic, mind-altering drugs and animals that, in Carlson’s own words, “people have always held superstitious beliefs towards”, and it’s in this timeless, countercultural frame-of-mind that Carlson really comes into his own. Like a time-travelling bard who’s somehow seen it all, from the ravages of the American civil war to the darkest side of contemporary rock culture, Carlson’s expressively detuned licks regale heavily accented, instrumental stories of life and death and the liminal spaces between, and most crucially with the labouring quality of a resident act who plays five-nights-a-week in a dusty saloon. Two durational highlights really set the scene at the album’s dawn and midnight, where he really rinses every last bit of distorted twang from his guitar, and both cuts act as gathering/diffusion of energies for what’s to come. In the first half ‘Datura’s Crimson Veil’ gives way to the sky-searching axe calligraphy of ‘Exaltation of Larks’ and comes down to bruxist grind of ‘The Colour of Poison’ and unpredictable turns of phrase and lacunæ in ‘Descending Belladonna’. At the album’s midnight, ’She Rides an Air of Malevolence’ then parts to the nocturnal solitude of ‘Maiden’s Catafalque’, but there’s a glimmer of hope cracking over distant mountaintops in ‘The Mandrake’s Hymn’, that ultimately follows with the resolute but resigned summation of ‘A Wretched Country of Dusk’. less"

   "name": "Masterful solo debut by Rupert Clervaux, regular collaborator with Beatrice Dillon, including the voice of Breadwoman alongside Clervaux’s own in a dreamlike recital of his poetry, set to a mix of wonderfully hypnagogic and unpredictable music backdrops ranging from twilight ambient to traces of Detroit techno, decayed solo piano, and spirited free jazz... “‘After Masterpieces’ sets six recitals of Rupert’s poetry in unique, unpredictable and expansive musical scenery. The enigmatic and densely compacted texts, reworked and gently honed throughout the album’s slow creation, find an aerial perspective from which a lifetime of reading, listening and thinking is carefully re-mapped. The broad thematic scope takes in aesthetics, ancient mythologies, the origins of language and music, epistemology and ecology––to name just a few––all of which remain tightly intertwined, resistant to abstraction, and imbued with a sense of inquisitive ambiguity which treats all certainty with suspicion: the listener is invited to find their own threads, draw their own conclusions and think their own thoughts––as Anna Homler once aptly said of her own work, “…it’s not didactic, it’s poetic.” Initially deriving its impetus from the mood and rhythm of the words, the album’s music utilises a wide-array of performance and production techniques. Clervaux draws on his full range of musical interests, creating long-form pieces that at turns support the recitals and then lead the way for the instrumental swathes within and between them. The sounds of ‘After Masterpieces’ revolve through the melodic ambience of ‘Her Fingers of Pink Light’; the dark electronics and multi-layered samples of ‘In Shadowlands of Like and Likeness’; the tentative interplay of piano and voice on ‘Damper and Drum’; and the riff-like patterned percussion and free improvisation of ‘Make Nature Speak.’ As the LP draws to a close, Homler and Bull join Rupert on ‘L’amore che Muove il Sole’—a sprawling anti-hymn, echoing the structure of ‘The Divine Comedy’, which discovers, in place of Dante’s heavenly paradise, a fragile optimism for positive change in the wreckage of failed grand narratives.” less"

   "name": "Composer, author and GRM overseer François Bonnet aka Kassel Jaeger commits a beautifully surreal batch of electroacoustic works to the Latency label following their LPs by Sam Kidel and Laurel Halo. Usually found on Editions Mego, Kassel Jaeger releases are notably admired for their attention to the finest textural detail, and for the way he classically draws a sense of dreamlike narrative from the ostensibly abstract and the non-musical. On ‘Le Lisse et le Strié’ the french composer typically puts that finesse at the service of of exploring two opposing concepts of “smooth” and “striated” within the electroacoustic sphere, where, “If the “smooth” is linked to “nomos” as an open space of organic distribution, the “striated”, on the contrary, is associated to “logos”, as an enclosed space defined by a grid.” Working in noumenal space between the “smooth” and ‘striated” aspects, Jaeger uses alchemical process to highlight sound’s unparalleled, amorphous ability to manifest or suggest structural changes that practically don’t occur in any other framework of nature other than musical perception. His sounds emulate paradoxical, conceptual leaps between physical states, melting our perception of time and space and the “grid” in the process, and pointing to a inception of encrypted, camouflaged sound as beguiling as a magic eye image for the ear. less"

For this reason, on the first side it is possible to listen to a classic réak ouverture, played by one of the two founding groups, Juarta Putra. On the other side one may hear Putra Jaya Melati: one of the groups that most attempts to push towards a contemporary, aggressive and experimental version of réak music, without leaving the cultural and spiritual background of the style behind. In this record, it is even possible to hear an electric guitar, gongs, a kendang and a very open repertoire of songs. “Kasenian réak is a genre of performative art from the Priangan area of west Java, organized during hajatans (life-cycle celebrations) and nowadays primarily held during weddings andcircumcisions. The style, known as a seni lungsuran, is part of the greater family of Javanese horse dances, originally known in their most famous forms of jathilan and kuda lumping. Javanese horse dances, which could be as old as animistic Java, may already have been practiced before the eight century, travelling through the island and reaching Priangan in the thirties, when réak is believed to have been originated and popularised by musical groups Juarta Putra and Maska Putra. While bearing more than some resemblances with its family, kasenian réak benefits of structures and aesthetic tracts of its own, being not only one of the newest developments of horse dance if not the newest, but also its rawest and most extreme outcome.” less"

Following from the first batch in 2015, Threshold Archives continue with a massive project initiated in 2006 by the band’s core member, Peter Christopherson, seeking to salvage material, which, over time, has been lost or has become scarce due to record label bankruptcies and intercontinental moves, where many masters were damaged, became degraded, or stuck on obsolete devices. The project began two years after the death of Christopherson’s partner and bandmate, Geoff Rushton aka Jhonn Balance, and four years before Peter passed in Thailand, 2010. As both core members have moved on to new dimensions, these posthumous releases are vital to disseminating their energies for further generations of dilated souls. Spanning decades and myriad aspects of Coil’s oeuvre, each CD variously packs vintage material with unreleased cuts, or simply and handily stacks up loads of dead hard-to-find gear on one disc. For example, their 1994 CD ‘Protection’ is expanded to include the piloerect effect of ‘pHILM #1 (Vox)’ alongside multiple versions of their balletic lecture workout ‘Static Electrician,’ and a haul of haunting offcuts including strange choral elves and a 10 minute acid gunk swill out, whereas ‘The Sound Of Musick’ pulls various soundtrack works ranging from the ‘Theme From Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex’ to the pulsing disco tricks of ‘Theme From Blue’ and 28 minutes of their soundtrack for 1992’s ‘Sara Dale's Sensual Massage’, and the ’Heartworms’ album focusses on various vocal works, both from Geoff as well as Taylor Mead, John Giorno and William S. Burroughs. The one that’s striking us most is ‘I Don’t Want To Be The One’, featuring material previously released on Hate People Like Us/Computer Music Journal/Emre comps, and including gems from the ‘Astral Disaster’ and later ELpH sessions, such as the severe warp of ‘Gnomic Verses’ and the 20 minutes of ‘Zwölf’ plus loads of digitally abstract studio gremlins.

Compiled by Brecht Van Dingenen and Ziggy Devriendt, ‘Le Personnage Principal Est un Peuple Isolé’ unfurls a sublime drift through Benjamin Lew’s singular sound world, where crystalline, analog computerised electronics meet a plethora of instrumental voices from the early ‘80s Belgian firmament; including among them his Tuxedomoon collaborator Steven Brown and Blaine L. Reininger, plus Vini Reilly, Marc Hollander, Samy Birnbach and many more.

Purchasing this LP will make your life 100% more sophisticated, we practically guarantee. “Benjamin Lew was an enlightened amateur, in the noble and almost Renaissance-like sense of the word: he dabbled with equal grace in photography, writing, visual arts ... and worked part-time as a cocktail mixer in a tropical bar which was one of the favourite watering holes of Brussels’ thriving artistic community of the early ‘80s. Tuxedomoon had just moved to Brussels, and Steven Brown was among the many musicians, designers & artists who patronized the bar. Benjamin had a secret passion: he wasn’t a musician, but had acquired a small analog computer, with which he had started creating these strange mysterious little pieces. Benjamin played them to Steven and asked him if he’d agree to record with him. Steven was taken with them and accepted. The Douzième Journée was largely created in the studio by both protagonists, with the help of Gilles Martin and myself, in the spring of ‘82. Listening to his albums (he went on to record four more with Crammed) is like embarking on a dream journey to the Sahara or the Far East. You’d think that some of the pieces feature non-European musicians or samples but: no... this is just Benjamin’s imagination, his synths, and his friends…” Marc Hollander, Feb. 2019” less"

   "name": "‘The Royal Garden Covered In Ash’ is a dream sequence of layered and mulched horror-style organs and synths concocted by ambient explorer Fabio Orsi and the maestro Brian Pyle of Ensemble Economique and Starving Weirdos. It's a proper goodun - highly recommended if yr into Dean Hurley's super atmospheric Lynchain sound design. Seemingly crafted to soundtrack bouts of sleep paraylsis, or the the heavy-lidded hypnagogic jerk phase, ‘The Royal Garden Covered In Ash’ says its piece in gloaming strokes with an overtone of menace that never quite manifests but lurks liminally, gnawing at the subconscious. ‘Belief is a whisper’ helms the front with a subaquatic swell of nocturnal crimson/blue/black hues that give way to Pyle’s typical, Vangelis-like brass flares and ghostly synth figures that fleet out of view just as quickly as they appeared, while the narrative subtly lures us into really noirish mindspaces. ’You’re So Close, I Can Almost Hold You Again’ phosphoresces on the back, hovering in and out of view with a beautifully elusive quality - sometimes tangible and shimmering, at others smudged and just outta reach - in a proper aether dream style. Beautiful, eerie music. less"

A strong new addition to both artists’ oeuvres, the 2nd Aasthma 12” follows the same formula as the first, and again finding a smart balance of immediate rawness and classy sound design, but this time slightly altering the parameters to more reckless and experimental appeal. The smoky ambient blush of ’Rotating Blue Device’ unfurls a fine mesh of gauzy mid-ground and prickly surface disturbances to bend the mind’s eye and presumably sound steeply psychedelic in altered states, which finely sets the tone for ‘Los Angeles’, where they spar with thorny techno drums and surges of bass voltage in a roving, undulating, crisp but distorted mass that will swill the club out something rotten.

As debuts go, ‘Luxury Death’ is a powerfully definitive statement of intent, driving a stake in the ground somewhere between the contemporary skools of JK Flesh, Prurient and Puce Mary, and the grizzled old battalions of Broken Flag and the ‘80s Italian industrial hordes. In that tradition, it’s built to be played LOUD, possessing the sort of biting-point amplitude control and a gauntleted grasp of barbed sonics that will make your speakers tremble with fear. Raising the tension with sci-fi cinematic strings and drop forge noise blasts in the first, the session sustains a stare down intensity until the end, holding listeners under waves of rhythmic noise with a water-boarding brutality, then leaving us to freeze in muddy trenches, surrounded by shellfire, before ultimately burying the senses with smeared drones. less"

The previously unheard ‘Dreamland’ sets out the album’s feel, sharing a esoteric. synthy vision with the other unreleased bit ‘Eastern Skies’, which also shares a naif, “orientalist” breeziness in common with ‘Indonesia Eyes’ and ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, while we find his percussive sensibilities pulled in new directions from the woozy ‘Shangri-La’, to the sprung step of ‘Volcano Cathedral’ and the Suba-esque ‘Olympus Mons.’ less"

Now, hot on the heels of an ace 1988 volume, ‘Visions’, they now unfurl more magick with that album’s follow-up, ‘Sojourn’, replete with three bonus tracks from the same 1989 sessions. It’s practically worth it for one of the unreleased bits, ‘Heartsong’, whose angelic synth chorale speaks as much to Young’s career as film soundtrack composer as his enduring influence over dance music, while ‘Fantasia’ uncannily follows suit with a choral riff that’s half a note away from the central motif in Forgemasters ‘Track With No Name’, but set to slow MIDI drums. The album continues to reveal special new angles thru the B-side’s other unreleased peach, an ambient-pop mediation ‘Ancient Past’ sounding like Arpanet meets Lewis, which triggers a marmite sequence of songs right on the cusp of new age fromage and stellar sincerity.

The album opens with Palestine stirring spectral tones from wine glasses, soon joined by the floating vocal presence of Haino and Ishibashi communing in midair until Haino cuts through with pealing guitar chords and a subbass looms, seemingly from nowhere. Next, Haino picks up his flute and they change shape to a quietly spirited jazz fusion sound almost defined more by the space between their notes than the notes themselves, and soon enough they converge on the heavy stuff, O'Rourke swangin' serious bass heft under the tensest drum crashes and claw-handed riffage. We could maybe do without the \"funkier\" mid-section bit, 'A new radiance springing forth from inside the light', but that small issue is resolved with the stomach-tightening ten minute swagger of 'Even That Still Here And Unwanted Can You And I Love It?

   "name": "There are few contemporary musicians who have had as much of an impact on us as Mika Vainio, so each new release is always cause for celebration. Whether exploring the grim underbelly of the electric guitar on ‘Life (… It Eats You Up)’ or haunted minimalism in his collaboration with Kevin Drumm and friends on ‘Venexia’, Vainio somehow manages to throw us into a state of awe consistently time and time again. ‘FE3O4 – Magnetite’ manages to uphold this quality but takes a stylistic about turn, exploring the two poles of noise and silence, finding Vainio explore distortion and contrast in a way he hasn’t for many years now. Radio static emerges from almost nothing, sounds appear for a second and are gone and cables are established and removed without warning. This dynamic is offset by Vainio’s well-documented expertise with very loud drones, and the drones we’re treated to on ‘FE3O4’ are louder and more intense than you’re likely to find almost anywhere else. Sub bass tones tear through the silence heralded only by small pops, and wavering, distorted oscillators cut and slice like a lone machete in a dark night. This is often terrifying music, but thanks to Vainio’s calm hand it never devolves into mere theatrics. Rather the sounds are so well paced and expertly handled that you feel like you are being treated to the work of a pioneer, and someone whose work is a direct descendent of Bernard Parmegiani, Luciano Berio and Throbbing Gristle. Incredible music, and yet another totally unmissable full-length from Mika Vainio. less"

It amounts to a vitally definitive entry in both artists’ catalogues, marking right up there with the most engrossing wonders of O’Rourke’s Steamroom volumes, while manifesting some of the most fascinating results from Von Hausswolff’s ongoing investigations into drone music’s paranormal properties. In other words: it’s Grade A+ zoner music, essential listening for followers of Roland Kayn, Jaap Vink, Deathprod. Initiated in Tokyo 2016 and completed over the proceeding two years in Japan and Sweden, the uncompromisingly adventurous results are galactic in scope and visceral in presence, conjuring scales of abyssal bass and diffused, atomised, abstract dark matter that make the listener feel like a speck of stardust floating in infinity. Using sound as a magickal tool for psychic transport and to finely model notions of the metaphysical that typically elude human comprehension, these two extended pieces feel to collapse billions of years into a glacial moment. Location recordings made in Kathmandu lend a barely-there iridescence, like microbial filaments flickering in the endless darkness, to their plunging, subharmonic basses and vaporised mid-upper registers, where spectral forces comb thru the piece to very gradually alter the weightless keen of our perception. It’s a masterclass in Cybernetic drone, a universe of sound created in a closed system gradually shifting within its own parameters, mutating into infinity. less"

Out on Danse Noire, Pleasures of the Bull finds the multi-disciplinary artist and producer flirting with the sounds of hard jazz while mystifying the parameters of experimental music across several distinct movements, thus allowing the listener to break free from their sonic principles. Intoxicating, ambient textures mesh with Abyss X’s own expressive vocals, as well as the sounds of the traditional Cretan lyra, played by Maria Skoula. Her sound modification creates a collage of temporalities – allow yourself to move outside linear dimensions, and her to confide in you. Prog rock guitar lines twist stolidly beneath warped vocal samples, and the timbre of the bowed lyra permeates the atmosphere in a thick, suffocating haze. As the listener travels through space and time, so too does the artist. Abyss X delves into the fullness of her craft, drawing from her background in theater and performance, in addition to the frenzied energy of her live shows as a musician. The music throbs with a frantic yet unmistakably deliberate drama. Pleasures of the Bull feels like a gentle punch in the gut; a compelling auditory performance and a bold exploration of the narrative album format.” less"

Biberkopf makes a fine addition to Aïsha Devi and co’s Danse Noire label with Fountain Of Meaning, offering a far more mannered and dreamlike follow-up to the deadly fwd cyber-punk-techno of his two LPs for Kuedo’s Knives. Make sure to check ‘Dance of Relating’! “Fountain of Meaning is a new sonic fiction from sound artist J.G. Biberkopf following last year’s Ecologies II: Ecosystems of Excess released on Knives. Emerging out of a situation of overflow, the record burrows deeper into his practice of palpable audio theater with a study of object and relations across space-time specific sounds. The Fountain as a theme reflects a spouting and spilling of information, an erotic gushing of imagined aural history. “The Fountain was the source of water in the public space in cities,” J.G. Biberkopf explains. “Now it’s pretty much a sexualised architectural gesture of both beautification and the spectacle of dominant ideologies.” The western classical musical canon, much like the perpetual coming of the fountain, flush the headphone space with stimuli. Reflex and memory guides the listener through a semiotic architecture of processed recordings of masses in Catholic churches and contemporary performances of pre-medieval music. A liquidity of structure has an anxious influence and is a closed system approach to form and imagination. When water flows, it fills every space, then spills over to claim more. History is equally abundant and alive. We have never had as much history as we have now. We have never been able to see ourselves as we can now. A knowledge of a grander architecture of knowing and recalling oppress the ecologies of human decision-making.The nature of the archive has transformed into a total and panoptic intelligence. A life is a gamble as the inventory of the world overflows into the production of a spectral third, an other, a confrontation. Fountain of Meaning offers a dynamic tension and release. A molecular tragedy, our abject recovery into a collaborative reimagining of a trauma long forgotten. “ less"

Rather than focusing upon deep psychological aspects of schizophrenia, Ghamccccxc vRR explores key moments before and during Réelle’s first schizophrenic psychosis as well as the lateral state of mind caused by this condition. “Schizophrenia is said to limit a person’s abilities overall. My discovery was that it opened a gate to limbic realms not accessible under normal circumstances – at least not to me.” The Cuban – German artist’s approach to schizophrenia as xenopraxis leads them to explore avant garde methods to composition, such as focusing on a key technique within their work of painting melodies via Image Synthesis, rather than inputting binary values or manipulating sound through skeuomorphic methods such as knobs and sliders. The painted melodies also featured in the gorgeous “Floating” and “All I Have Left” evoke alien soliloquies through damaged soundscapes. “Most of these sounds, as well as the album title, were created during psychosis without me consciously knowing what I’m doing. Therefore I also can’t remember when or why I wrote down Ghamccccxc vRR on a piece of paper.” Ghamccccxc vRR questions how one navigates with authorship within and beyond one’s control. Gargling textures and vocal artefacts oscillate between the erotic and the eerie (“Hybris,” “Fluid Metals”). Between Kissing Myself and Ghamccccxc vRR Réelle dissolves the real and illusion, reassembling their relationship between body and mind.” less"

If you’ve ever been caught by the work of Oren Ambarchi, Jim O’Rourke, Andrew Chalk, John Duncan or Jean-Claude Éloy, you need to clasp ears on this album! “Tint is the first new solo recording from Joe Talia in over a decade. Australian-born but now based in Tokyo, Talia is known to many listeners as a drummer (frequently collaborating both live and in the studio with artists such as Oren Ambarchi and Jim O’Rourke) and as a recording and mixing engineer responsible for dozens of releases across the fields of contemporary experimental music, wayward pop, and jazz. Alongside James Rushford, he is also responsible for one of the most legendary releases in the Kye records catalogue, the creaking electronic morass of Manhunter (2013). Lovingly crafted over many months in his tiny Tokyo studio, Tint is an album-length electroacoustic suite that brings together Talia’s expertise as percussionist, studio engineer, and performer on analogue electronic instruments (primarily modular synth and Revox tape machine). Ranging from minimalist austerity to kosmische lushness, Tint refreshingly refuses the dark and moody sonic palette of much contemporary electroacoustic music in favour of an airy, at times almost weightless sound-world of gliding tones, skittering percussion, and burbling field recordings. Drawing inspiration from Jean-Claude Eloy’s epic concrète love letter to Tokyo, Gaku-No-Michi, Talia makes extensive use of his own recordings of his new home, but removes any sense of audio verite, abstracting them into transparent glosses of outdoor ambience or unidentifiable chimes and creaks. Flowing seamlessly between distinct episodes, Tint is compositionally controlled while retaining a sense of played spontaneity, eventually building to a maelstrom of analogue synth zaps and tape manipulated percussion that reflects Talia’s deep engagement with the relentless yet constantly shifting dynamics of free jazz.” less"

   "name": "‘Songs Without Throats’ is a large dose of zany brilliance from Paul DeMarinis - a Robert Ashley collaborator and member of The League of Automatic Composers - featuring work exclusively selected and compiled for Oren Ambarchi’s leading edge label, Black Truffle Paul DeMarinis is a graduate of the famous Mills College, where he studied composition with Robert Ashley and Terry Riley, leading to his formative role in the world’s first computer “band” - The League of Automatic Composers with David Behrman and co - and his credit playing Moog on Ashley’s legendary album, ‘In Sara, Mencken, Christ and Beethoven There Were Men and Women.” Those credits aside, DeMarinis is also a wildly creative composer in his own right, with a body of work that probes perceptive schisms between natural and synthesised sounds in the most playful, beguiling manner. Drawn from material found on compilations, together with stacks of work previously unheard in any form, ‘Songs Without Throats’ is a very necessary introduction to DeMarinis’ charming soundworld. Focussing on his output between the late ‘70s and 1995, it presents a hugely playful demonstration of digitally manipulated speech sounds, simulated pastoralism, and clinically sharp tones all threaded together with a mean sense of humour and adventurousness to provide a first time peek behind the curtain of his studio in the ‘80s. Much of the work was produced off-the-cuff in the process of developing structures that began in live rehearsals. As such they’re relatively stripped down and shy of FX, yet they remain fascinating on merit of DeMarinis’ nascent naivety and explorative nature, abundant with the type of sounds that make your ear crease and pucker: from the way he turns a rare 78rpm sample of Stalin into birdsong using the formants of his voice; to the speak ’n spell froth of his catalogue highlight ‘Kokole’ [1985]’ to his canny balance of natural and synthetic speech with longterm collaborator Anne Klingensmith; and his dotty, proto-chiptune, dance-pop rhythms in the likes of ‘R4T’, ‘Eenie Meanie Chillie Beanie’, and ‘Yellow Yankee.’ less"

   "name": "Fascinating turn of incredible, private electro-acoustic designs by Italy’s Massimo Toniutti - brother of Giancarlo, of ‘Broken Flag’ LP fame - originally self-released in 1991 and now sniffed out, expanded with a bonus album’s worth of gear, and reissued by Oren Ambarchi’s faultless Black Truffle. To our ears, this little known masterpiece bridges a gap between Gruppo and Giuseppe Ielasi, rendering freely disciplined and brilliantly unpredictable arrangements of detailed field recordings and mechanical sounds that happen and unfold with a naturalistic quality that’s totally key to its immersive allure. Big RIYL Nurse With Wound, Roland Kayn, Giuseppe Ielasi, Gruppo D’improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza. \"Massimo Toniutti was active in the vibrant underground industrial/noise scene of the 1980s, contributing to releases on legendary labels such as Broken Flag and RRR and self-releasing a series of cassettes between 1984 and 1988. Existing in a private world apart from the noise and dark industrial tropes of many of his contemporaries, Toniutti’s Il Museo Selvatico is an entirely singular work of domestic electro-acoustic exploration. Made up primarily of what Toniutti calls “small and rare noises” or sonic “knick-knacks” recorded between 1987 and 1990, the five pieces that make up the original LP usher us into a crepuscular space populated by mysterious traces of everyday life. Toniutti weaves a loose net of distant clanks, dull thuds, metallic resonance, and skittering percussive sounds, allowing the sounds to breathe against a backdrop of near-silent atmosphere. Although the haunted ambience recalls the work of contemporaries like Organum, Toniutti generally steers clear of long tones and drones, preferring to arrange brief, sometimes staccato sonic objects into patterns of repeating figures and isolated events whose overall compositional shape remains somehow ungraspable. Although glimpses of recognizable location recordings and instrumental sounds can occasionally be made out, for most of the record the sources of the sounds you hear remain teasingly mysterious, an abstracted memory of everyday actions and atmospheres. Il Museo Selvatico is accompanied here by an additional LP of material recorded at the same time, arranged especially for this reissue into two side-long suites that inhabit the same haunted space as the original LP while occasionally making use of more maximal compositional strategies. Essential listening for fans of Organum, Nurse With Wound, Christoph Heemann, and the tradition of outsider musique concrete.” Highly Recommended. less"

Beginning with chiming percussion reminiscent of Haino's 1995 classic Tenshi No Gijinka, the first side is dominated by Haino's impassioned vocals and performance on the bulgari, a traditional Turkish string instrument. The end of the second side presents a special treat: Haino's first recorded outing on the contrabass harmonica, from which he coaxes bizarre, wheezing textures against a backdrop of spacious bass and percussion. O'Rourke and Ambarchi rarely adopt here the classic rock roles essayed on earlier releases. O'Rourke's bass, which takes center-stage surprisingly often, is sometimes so heavily processed by his array of pedals that it becomes a shifting electronic mass; at other times his roving chromaticism suggests a sort of fuzzed-out free jazz. Ambarchi spends much of the set exploring areas of tumbling free pulse; and even when he locks into a constantly repeated figure on the set's third side, he gestures as much toward Ronald Shannon Jackson's stuttering marching band funk as toward any classic rock moves. When the trio finally moves in the final quarter of the performance into an extended passage of rock riffing, the payoff is immense, as they craft a thudding one-chord epic reminiscent of some of the early Fushitsusha classics before Haino returns to the bulgari, bringing the set back to where it began. Continuing to explore new instrumental and dynamic possibilities while remaining grounded in the trio's previous work, this set also brings with it a unique pleasure for the non-Japonophone listener: for the first time Haino sings many of his metaphysically brooding lyrics in English.” less"

The 8 tracks of ‘The Tuffest of the Tuff’ are kicking testament to the irrevocable Afro-Caribbean influence on British dance music and popular culture since the 2nd half of the 20th C. From the effortless, swinging soul flow of ‘Africa’, starring ace vox by Sharon Hammend & Allison Gray, thru to Addis Posse’s acid breakbeat rave killer ‘Let The Warriors Dance’, to the New Beat-compatible electro of ‘Je T’Aime’ by Housemaids, in their subbass-heavy spin on Larry Heard-like Chi-house in James Harris’ ‘Tuffest of the Tuff’, and the beautifully prescient vision of new age flutes, vocals and rolling lushness in Watts Noize’s ‘It’s My Life (Dub Mix)’ classic, this is pretty unmissable gear for anyone tracing the Afro-futurist roots of UK rave and techno beyond Warp and back to source. less"

   "name": "'Lonely At The Top' is a suitably bleary-eyed awakening, feeling as if it's attempting to comprehend the rapid glut of information in the waking world, and failing to do so - opting for a massive spliff instead and allowing it all to smudge in by osmosis. Ok, so in the intervening years Lukid did usher out two singular 12\"s of deconstructed House and Techno on his Glum label, both marking a distinct shift from his previous productions and which, in turn, clearly inform the deceptively freeform feel of this LP. And we say \"deceptively\" because there's a genuinely crafty pair of hands pulling the strings behind the abstract, distorted daubs of soundcolour and rhythmelody. But, like Actress's 'R.I.P', what separates this from becoming a mush of avant-garde texture and timbre experimentation is the instinctive and coherent sense of narration to 'Lonely At The Top', one which expands and contracts between dusted blobs of haunted swagger like 'Manchester' and the heat-sick title track through to 'Southpaw''s rugged bounce or the compelling emotion of 'USSR' via poignant vignettes like his OPN-esque 'The Life Of The Mind' or the achingly cute 'Snow Theme'. Easily Lukid's finest work to date and a strong counterpoint to the overly-emosh post-whatever albums doing the rounds at the moment. less"

While the previous session was a proper face melter, this one, made in March 2013, is a far more subtle and diverse session. It starts up with a beautifully delicate duet between Keiji's vocals and Finnish Kantele and O'Rourke's lyrical 12-string haunted by Ambarchi's wine glass tones (rubbing not drinking), before letting Jim take the lead with nimbly fluid improvisation and scaling up into twsted electronic noise and globular subbass pulses by the mid-way point. The three climax naturally as the noise energy dissipates to leave them seemingly enervated, Haino's post-tristesse wail cutting through the room like a wounded animal and baiting a 2nd wind of modular freakery and tribal ecstasies. less"

In ‘Uingizaji Hewa’ the tempos thrillingly tilt over the 200bpm mark, but they’re held in check with a clutch of slower instrumentals written in Duke’s newer Hip Hop Singeli style.

His musical activities that lead him all around the globe for performances (a.o. at Carnegie Hall) branch into 2 different areas: on the one side ALIZADEH is a highly reputed virtuoso on his traditional instrument, on the other he likes to approach music from a more experimental / technological aspect in his electronic / electro-acoustic pieces. This not being enough, he founded Noise Works in 2014, a platform and label for organizing experimental concerts and for the transfer of knowledge of music technologies among young Iranian musicians which makes him a central figure at the forefront of the current, very vivid Persian music scene that gained a lot of attention through artists like SIAVASH AMINI, PORYA HATAMI and of course SOTE who included a track by ALIZADEH on the compilation “Girih: Iranian Sound Artists” that he had curated. In 2018, ALIZADEH self-released his debut “Scattered Memories” on CD in Iran which now, in a reworked version, sees its deserved world-wide release as LP and DL.

   "name": "150 minutes of previously unreleased material from Coil, strewn with parts that would eventually metastasise into ‘Backwards’, and ultimately ‘Black Light District’ and ‘Musick To Play In The Dark’. We hardly need to stress that ’Swanyard’ is a bounty for Coil nuts out there, but equally a fascinating listen for anyone attempting to get to grips with their unfathomable catalogue - especially DJs and listeners currently digging into the underbelly of the ‘90s. The material was all written and recorded between 1993 to 1996 and was selected and assembled by Danny Hyde (Electric Sewer Age, ex-Coil, ex-Psychic TV, ex-Black Light District) from the studio archives. As he outlines in the liner notes, these 23 tracks offer unforetold snapshots of Coil’s constant work-in-progress during an important phase of exploration. Tracks were usually seeded in Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson’s dreams, and rendered thru the prism of his myriad sample bank, with Jhon Balance pulling from his notebooks for lyrics, and Danny Hyde would aid in engineering, editing and mixing, animating their studio gremlins and mental apparitions to an almost complete form. The ’Swanyard’ is effectively as close as you’ll get to being in their notorious studios during the pharmaceutically-fuelled peak of the ‘90s, at the point where dark ambient, electronica and dance music were mutual bedfellows, and mutated the framework for where we are today. less"

But over the years, Wiggs has released several of her own albums, all of which delightfully defy genre. Her new solo record, We Fall, is both a departure and a distillation of an enduring personal aesthetic: moody and spare but also melodic, at once contemporary and nostalgic. \"Some influences are clear: We Fall is reminiscent of the experimentalism of Brian Eno’s Another Green World and recalls the delicate, languid minimalism of Harold Budd. The album’s classical inflections, sharpened by a dialog with electronic elements, evoke Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto. This is an album of juxtapositions: minimalist at moments, richly layered in others; ambient while also sharply focused; melancholy yet resolute. There's something both dreamy and scientific about We Fall. Wiggs, an enthusiastic amateur mycologist, has an impressive collection of mushrooms she’s photographed in her travels. We Fall could be the soundtrack to what can’t be captured in a single photo—the growth and decay of miraculous creatures that a less astute and sensitive eye might overlook entirely. Composed, performed and recorded by Wiggs, with drums and electronics by her longtime friend and collaborator Jon Mattock (Spacemen 3, Spirit , We Fall is a lyrical, bucolic album with an undercurrent of disquiet. Think of a wintertime walk in the woods as dusk falls too soon. True to the classic album form, the 10 almost entirely instrumental tracks on We Fall form a compelling whole: a crystalline meditation on paths not taken and words unspoken, an elegy for moments lost and last embraces.\" less"

   "name": "The video installation Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore (1999) is one of the best known and loved works by Turner Prize-winning artist and Northern English emigre, Mark Leckey. It's a hugely influential piece, and the soundtrack itself has been sampled endlessly, most notably by Jamie XX on “All Under One Roof Raving”. It was the first release on The Death of Rave label back in 2012 and is now finally back in print, this time on clear vinyl. A phantasmic and transcendent collage of meticulously sourced and rearranged footage and sound samples spanning three decades of British subculture - from Northern Soul thru '80s Casuals and pre-CJB Rave - it may be considered an uncanny premonition of the Hauntological zeitgeist which has manifested in virulent sections of UK electronic dance and pop culture since the early '00s. This record severs the sonic aspect from the moving image, offering a new perspective on what rave culture maven and esteemed author Simon Reynolds calls \"a remarkable piece of sound art in its own right.\" Detached from its visual indicators, Leckey's amorphous, acephalic cues are reframed as an ethereal, Burroughsian mesh of VHS idents, terrace chants, fragmented field recordings and atrophied samples cut with his own half-heard drunken mumbles. At once recalling and predating the eldritch esthetics of Burial or The Caretaker; it's an elegiac lament for an almost forgotten spirit; an abstracted obituary to the rituals, passions and utopian ideals of pre-internet, working class nightlife fantasias, now freeze-framed forever, suspended in vinyl. It's backed with an edit of another soundtrack to a Mark Leckey video installation: 'GreenScreenRefrigeratorAction' (2010). In stark contrast, the original video features a black Samsung Bottom Freezer Refrigerator stood in front of a green screen infinity cyc, recounting its contents, thoughts and actions as narrated by the artist in a radically transformed cadence. Taken as a wry comment on cybernetics and the ambient ecology of household appliances which permeate our daily lives, it's an unsettling yet compelling piece of sound design whose subtly affective dynamics reflect the underlying dystopic rhetoric with visceral and evocative precision. The piece has since been used in a collaboration with Florian Hecker for the Push and Pull exhibition at Tate Modern in 2011. less"

   "name": "A study in friction and sublimity, transitioning from gritty airborne textures to droning, somnolent songcraft... “Two Words is the debut release from the duo of Canadian sound artist crys cole and Australian songwriter Francis Plagne. Building on a series of experimental live performances in which the pair toyed with possible common languages for their seemingly unrelated approaches to music, the LP's two sides present a single piece that brings together abstract texture and slow-motion song in a sonic space where genre cedes to the logic of dreams. The piece begins with a long, nearly static sequence built primarily from rubbed surfaces, using movement in the stereo field and changing mic placements to create a unified but unstable sonic environment that mimics wind, water, and breath, opening an impossible space between nature and artifice. This artificial outdoors ultimately makes room for Plagne's electric organ, which sounds a series of melancholic chords to accompany a wandering Wyatt-esque keyboard line as cole's intimate contact mic textures sizzle and pop in the foreground. From here the piece makes a surprise detour into song, as the majority of the second side finds Plagne intoning a series of obtuse two-word phrases (from a text by Berlin-based poet Marty Hiatt) to an austere organ accompaniment. Working closely with engineer and producer Joe Talia, cole and Plagne extend the studio-as-an-instrument tradition of Teo Macero and This Heat, introducing subtle yet unexpected production shifts that lead the listener from the initial austerity of the organ and voice to an oneiric space of asynchronized vocal doubles, creaking textures, and distant whistling, ultimately arriving at something like an imagined meeting of Organum and Arthur Russell. Packaged in a suitably mysterious sleeve featuring a lush work by Australian painter Anne Wallace on the front and text by Hiatt on the back, Two Words is both comforting and strange, a disorienting blend of seemingly discrepant elements.” less"

Known to many listeners outside Japan primarily for her early collaborations with members of Can, Phew has been undergoing something of a creative renaissance in the last few years, prolifically recording and releasing a body of work that strips away the band arrangements present on most of her past releases to focus solely on her raw DIY electronics and possessed vocal stylings. Forming a perfect companion to 2017’s well-received Voice Hardcore, a series of pieces composed of only her processed voice that saw Phew push her work into the most abstract terrain yet, Patience Soup finds the trio inhabiting an uneasy landscape of moans, howls, and smeared electronic sonorities. Presented in atmosphere-enhancing room fidelity, the set begins in crunching textural abstraction and Phew’s vocal asides, set against a backdrop of Ambarchi’s shimmering Leslie-cabinet guitar tones and O’Rourke’s synthetic slivers. A testament to the risk-taking prowess of these three master improvisers, the performance moves organically from ecstatic crescendos powered by Phew’s processed wails to moments of near-silence in which a translucent veil of lingering electronic tones is gently punctuated by O’Rourke’s chiming piano chords. Constantly shifting, both harmonically and dynamically, Patience Soup is suffused throughout with a haunted energy and shows these three established figures continuing to venture out into uncharted territory.” less"

Duncan is perhaps most well known for his notorious early performances pieces, which explored violence, self-denial, and the establishment of extreme psychological and physical states in both artist and audience. Alongside these transgressive experiments, Duncan began to create audio works primarily using short wave radio. Where some of Duncan's earlier recordings are composed of magnificently sculpted but abrasive walls of noise, Klaar, recorded while Duncan was living in Amsterdam, occupies a more meditative territory. Opening with 'Delta', which layers long tones seemingly sourced from slowed down voices over a distant, watery field recording, the remainder of the first side is occupied with the epic title piece, which arranges shortwave radio abstraction, vocal experiments, and field recordings (street sounds, fireworks, monastic chants) into an episodic cinema for the ear. The second side is dominated by the long, brooding 'The Immense Room', where layers of shortwave interference and field recordings are gradually built up into a pulsing, wavering bed of sound infused with a subtly disturbing sense of psychological unrest. This rises to the surface near the end of the piece as sexual moans and ominous rumbles crisscross the stereo image before being abruptly brought to a halt. A singular work of electroacoustic composition, Klaar is both compositionally sophisticated and infused with a sense of mystery and a vital reality often lacking in more academic experimental music; it sits proudly alongside contemporaneous recordings by Duncan's friends and collaborators Jim O'Rourke and Christoph Heemann and is a must for anyone interested in their work. - Francis Plagne” less"

Years in the works, the 5-track ‘Perfect Oracle’ EP finds Xyn Cabal poetically turning the pressures of life in Athens and the modern world into diamond-cut but deliquescent future club music. It’s a cuttingly critical exploration of dance music dramaturgy, crystallising fluid tessellations of dembow, gqom, weightless grime and kuduro rhythms with emotive, bittersweet melodic arrangements influenced by a timeless and deeply rooted conception of the syncretic, fractious culture and politics that plays out in his everyday life in between his studies of mathematical logic and the riots which occur on exactly the same city streets most weeks since the 2008 financial crash. On the A-side his 9 minute blinder ‘Ǝ’ traverses a post-apocalyptic playground of brittle but shatterproof dembow drums, minor key synths and black hole trance breakdowns, before ‘Nowei’ unfurls a grimy cinematic elegy for the dispossessed. On the B-side, his permutations of Arabic vocals and subbass loops synch with upended drums in the EP’s titular highlight, while ‘Veil Ordnance’ pushes his rhythm programming to breathtaking, spiralling im/possibilities begging to be interpreted by contemporary dance companies, and ‘MSF Venom’ sounds the riot with slow motion Molotov drops turned into a noisy reggaeton beast. The results resonate with music from TCF and Æ thru to Total Freedom, Arca and Croww, but crucially and uniquely, Xyn Cabal’s music strives to consolidate a much broader set of reference points, navigating mathematically psychedelic, emotive, and remarkably meta routes between hyperlocal, rhizomatic, and cosmic nodes of the world’s dancefloor.

   "name": "Siskiyou returns from a four-year hiatus with Not Somewhere, an album that finds band leader Colin Huebert (ex-Great Lake Swimmers) essentially in solo artist mode, writing and self-recording this new collection of tunes on his own, playing all the guitar, bass, keyboard and drum parts himself. \"Not Somewhere harkens back to Siskiyou’s magical and understated 2010 self-titled debut in this and other ways: the album’s production rekindles a homespun intimacy, where plain-spoken lyrics grapple with portraits of quiet quotidian despair, fragile existential horizon lines separating perseverance and defeatism, honest and unremarkable lives trapped in cultures of false consciousness, impossible desire, self-analysis and self-medication. Following Siskiyou’s Polaris-nominated third full-length Nervous released in early 2015, Huebert was commissioned by New York-based artist/designer Stefan Sagmeister (of Sagmeister & Walsh) to write the theme song for The Happy Film, a feature-length movie accompaniment to “The Happy Show” installation project that had toured galleries in the mid-2010s – the art show and film themselves being ruminations on happiness that strongly echo Huebert’s own tone and sensibility. Sagmeister wanted the direct, unadorned aesthetic of early Siskiyou for the film music, leading Huebert to often write and record songs in the same day, in diaristic sketchbook form, without a thought towards the more ornate structures and developments of material he had just finished up with Nervous. This commission yielded the album’s title and the opening track “Stop Trying”(the eventual theme song for the movie) which includes a short looped clip of film dialogue repeating the line “trying is the problem; you’re trying to get somewhere as if you’re not somewhere”. Huebert ended up with a dozen songs written under this influence, but shelved the recordings while real life took over: driven from Vancouver by skyrocketing rents and zombie capital that was increasingly leaving the city a shell of its former self, he relocated to Toronto with his young family. Returning to the material once resettled, Huebert finished up the record with contributions from various guest musicians on strings and horns (including cellist and labelmate Rebecca Foon from Saltland/Esmerine, and Destroyer regulars Joseph Shabason and JP Carter on horns and woodwinds). The result is a beautifully restrained and unvarnished song cycle of tunes anchored by acoustic guitar and brushed drumming, detailed with delicate textures, spartan melodic overdubs, and Huebert’s distinctively forthright, whisperingly confidential vocal delivery. From the austere Velvets-chug of “What Ifs” to the Elephant 6-inspired looseness of “Her Aim Is Tall” and “Stop Trying (jubilant reprise)” and the sparkling hush of atmospheric twilight folk-inflected pieces like “Temporary Weakness” and “Silhouette”, Not Somewhere is delicate and discreet yet wonderfully assured – a profoundly humble, wistfully observational and meditatively personal return for Huebert’s Siskiyou project.” less"

   "name": "Luke Younger yields his most engrossing work as Helm with the sorely romantic dynamics of ‘Chemical Flowers’, his follow-up to 2015’s ‘Olympic Mess’. Bolstered by J.G. Thirlwell’s rich string arrangements, it’s a hugely ambitious work that extends from whirling, panoramic vistas to insular, pulsing dynamics, somewhere between Earth, Oren Ambarchi, Keiji Haino and Actress. Recorded in long, sustained sessions in the Essex countryside, giving him breathing room from the choke of London, ‘Chemical Flowers’ feels more elusive and ambitious than anything we’ve heard from Helm recordings in the past. While typically concerned with the nature and sound ecology of urban life, the Helm sound now feels more edgeland, drawing on a sense of marshy menace and concrete-meets-country dread limned so evocatively in classic J.G. Ballard novels, and surely recognisable by anyone in the UK beyond off-grid folk in Pembrokeshire or the Scottish highlands, perhaps. Given the luxury of space and time, Younger detectably reflects on past experience touring and playing live, as ambiguous nods to the strings and tones used in his Egyptian ‘Rawabet’ recordings subtly colour and marble the eight tracks, thanks to string parts arranged by J.G. Thirlwell (Foetus/Manorexia/Xordox, The The), plus saxophone from Karl D’Silva and Lucinda Chua’s cello. These acoustic touches lend human sweat and grease to proceedings which Younger uses sparingly but crucially in his electronically sculpted stagings. In effect, Helm pulls something hallucinatory from the mundane and prosaic, akin to viewing other dimensions refracted and projected into the dark from within a brightly lit bus or train carriage during a long commute, when the mind slips into the realm between reality and waking dreams. As we pass under the flight paths and neon, microtonal ephemera of ‘Capital Crisis (New City Loop)’ this nocturnal mindset plays out in the most absorbing ways, slipping from Yves Tumor or David Axelrod-like symphonic soul strokes and trip hop drums in ‘I Knew You Would Respond’ then the ambient noise qwheeze of ‘Body Rushes’, while ‘Lizard In Fear’ captivates with its hyperrealist electroacoustic evocation of a drowned Thames estuary, and the title and gnawing tone of ‘Toxic Racecourse’ could be an allegory for London itself. But Younger makes sure to keep that view of London ambiguous, at arms length, by returning to hypnotic rhythms like the doomy pulse of ‘You Are The Database’ that glumly precedes ‘Chemical Flowers’, a majestic widescreen synth piece that poignantly manifests the allure and promise of the city as much as its isolating qualities. Stunning. less"

   "name": "slowthai speaks up for an articulate, proud, British working class youth in his cracking debut album, featuring production by Kwes Darko and guest bars by Skepta Hailing from Northampton in England’s rolling Midlands, slowthai raps about his place in society as a young, mixed race man who grew up raised by his mother during Tory-imposed austerity. While raging vitriol would be totally warranted for his background, and is a key part of his lyrics (usually aimed at the heads of Teresa May and Brexiters) slowthai handles his subject matter with a head that’s wiser than his years might suggest, possessing a crucial ability to look beyond himself and how he relates to his generation and community. To date most of slawthai’s singles and an EP were capably self-produced on FL Studio, but for ‘Nothing Great About Britain’ Kwes Darko handles much of the production and mixing, with slowthai supplying only a couple of co-production credits alongside JD Reid and Slaves. Left to the mic, he clearly resembles a yung Dizzee Rascal, and even acknowledges this fact in the album’s titular opener, but make no mistake he’s not a clone; the album proceeds to roundly beat Sleaford Mods at their own game in the punkish trample of ‘Doorman’, while ‘Grow Up’ and ‘Inglorious’ exert his own spin on drill, the latter starring Skepta, and ‘Northampton’s Child’ shuts it down with a a type of minor key lament about never-ending 12 hour shifts, drug-addicted parents and punching you ’til his hands turn blue, that you won’t hear from any other MC this year. less"

After brightening our days with the opiate beauty of Barthel, Bohm and Bauer and the dusky grafts of Moon B last year, Basso’s well tended imprint begins 2016 with an antipodean gem. The green fingered, or thumbed, among you might recognise A.R.T. Wilson from his time in the Growing Bin a while back, when he soothed our cares with the drifting dreamscape of ‘Overworld’. Now the sometime club menace returns to Hamburg’s finest label in the company of numerical pioneer Eleventeen Eston AKA John Tanner for another journey into the heart of the horizontal. Setting up camp where the Swan River meets the Indian Ocean, Wilson and Tanner tuned into nature, translating the warm sun, sea air and blue sky into a postcard from paradise. Lithe clarinet dances around tranquil piano, relaxed guitar decorates velvet synth textures and unhurried percussion makes an occasional appearance, as if to remind us that time’s still passing. Employing an innovative alfresco recording technique, Andy and John invited members of the local animal community to join their jam sessions, saving a Blue Swimmer Crab from the flames of the barbecue and encouraging him to claw the ivories. Drop the needle and drift away on the distant ocean of “Pilot”, freefall into the soothing ambience of ‘Further Than Your Headlights’, and let “Sun Room” guide you gently back to terra firma. The dream team of Australian musicians (not to mention a very talented crustacean), come together on one vinyl – and it’s better than you could possibly imagine.” less"

   "name": "You’ve definitely seen their name on a poster over the years if you live in the UK, and now, if the mood takes one, Hey Colossus can be heard on vinyl for Luke Younger aka Helm’s Alter label “Coming out of London and the South West of England, Hey Colossus are one of Europe's great live bands. Since 2003 the 6-piece has been driving around the continent with their “pirate ship” backline of broken amps and triple-guitar drang, elevating audiences in every type of venue imaginable; a doctor’s waiting room in Salford, an industrial unit in Liege and a vast field next to a river in Portugal. Wherever they may roam. Four Bibles is their twelfth studio album and the first to be released by London label ALTER, whose sole proprietor (the electronic producer Helm) encountered the group at their first gig in 2003. Recorded by Ben Turner at Space Wolf Studios in Somerset, it's their most direct album yet and follows a well-documented trajectory of evolution that began (in the truest sense) with 2011’s RRR for Riot Season and continued across three albums for Rocket Recordings. Lead vocalist Paul Sykes sounds more in focus than before, dialling down the effects and using reverb / delay to carry his lyrics rather than smother. The band has also fine-tuned to leave some room for extra depth. Piano, electronics and violin (by Daniel O'Sullivan of This is not This Heat / Grumbling Fur) all find a way in amongst a familiar mesh of interlacing guitars, wrapped round a taut rhythm section. Like every other Hey Colossus record before, the line-up has altered and the sounds reflect this. From the weight of “Memory Gore”, to the subtlety and swag of “It's a Low”, via the sonic extremes of “Palm Hex/Arndale Chins” this is exactly as the band are live; raging & rail-roading but somehow in control. Grooves for those who want to dance or for those who want to hug a wall and nod...bleak dystopian imagery submerged in relentless rhythms and low-end rattle. The songs breath life and soul - Hey Colossus have never sounded fresher or more on point.” less"

That stepping title track is a peach! \"Isle Of Jura digs deep going back 40 years for the reissue of Harry's 1979 album which is something of an undiscovered gem that touches upon Disco, Funk, Boogie, Soul and Dub. Harry passed away in 2012 and we’ve worked closely with his son on the reissue. Harry Mosco is best known as the founder of legendary 1970s Nigerian Afro-Funk band The Funkees. Originating as an Army band after the Nigerian Civil War they lead the wave of upbeat music produced by young artists in Nigeria in response to the darkness of the recently concluded civil conflict. Following a notable hit single ‘Akula Owu Onyeara’ the band split in 1977 and Harry pursued a solo career. ‘Peace & Harmony’ was Harry’s third LP continuing the rich vein of form found in previous albums ‘Country Boy’ and ‘Funkees’ (For You Specially). He was a visionary who wrote, arranged and produced each song on the LP assisted by Mark Lusari on engineering duties (P.I.L, Jah Wobble & Prince I), whose Reggae and Dub influence can be felt on title track ‘Peace & Harmony’ and ‘Peaceful Dub’. The LP contains two certified floorfillers of Studio 54 era Disco Funk in the shape of ‘Sexy Dancer’ & ‘Step On’ and two slow jams, the soulful ballad ‘She’s Gone’ and horn lead album closer ‘Do It Together’. Mr Funkees was printed on the cover to help record buyers make the connection between Mosco and his former band\" less"

Snares, AFX of Hrvatski, and the kind of clipped, hypermodern computer music you’d expect to find on FLUF or from Co La. Their seven original cuts buckle and warp with an infectious tension between looseness and precision, serving dancers with myriad options for interpretation in each cut, from the hyper-jungle vortices of ‘Plasma Sunrise’ and ‘Integer’ at the front, thru to more rotted drums and Plaid-like melody in ‘Rusted Silicon’, and onto Jlin-esque balletic proprioceptions in ‘Resort’ and the dextrous tribalism of ‘Along The Synthetic River’, while allowing for more enigmatic space in the mix with ‘Uncanny’, and the shimmering keys that perfuse ‘Lab White’. Currently also exploring mutant 160bpm terrain, Sam Kerridge proves an apt choice to remix ‘Integer / Along The Synthetic River’, tying a Photek-style drums in Autechrean knots, while Nahash reorganises ‘Plasma Sunrise’ with a sack of gabber bass hits, and Sote impresses most with a Persian Electro-Acoustic rework of ‘Lab White’, diffused into glorious hyperspace harmonics. less"

   "name": "Rich, multi-layered vocal studies and shortwave electronics from avant-garde polymath John Duncan (LAFMS, collaborator with Pan Sonic, Chris & Cosey, Jim O’Rourke and countless others), bolstered by synths, drum machines and arrangements by Joachim Nordwall. Highly recommended if you’re into anything from Scott Walker and Pere Ubu to Jay Glass Dubs, Coil and Ilpo Väisänen’s classic Liima Versions.​ Venerable avant-garde composer John Duncan follows his prized cycle of cover versions ‘Bitter Earth’ [2016] with ‘Conventional Wisdom’; a truly beguiling suite of original, stony avant-blooz songs produced in collaboration with iDEAL boss Joachim Nordwall, and marking another high point in both of their respective catalogues. After coming out as a vocalist to memorably striking effect in 2016, Duncan compounds the effect by placing his original lyrics in stark arrangements ranging from shortwave radio-streaked dark ambient settings and Mika Vainio-esque isolationism, to deathly dubs driven by Nordwall’s rugged rhythms in a style that heavily recalls Jay Glass Dubs’ recent ‘Epitaph’ LP. An original and close associate of LAFMS co-founder Tom Recchion, and collaborator with everyone from Chris & Cosey to Asmus Tietchens, Merzbow and Andrew Mckenzie (The Hafler Trio), Duncan is well versed in the art of f*cking with music. Doing so since the ‘70s, it’s only in recent years that more “typical” song structures have crept into his style with most transfixing effect, gathering the attention of many who previously weren’t necessarily exposed to his music. Whether stemming from a perverse pleasure in twisting popular music, or a matter of changing with age (dude is 65), we’re just not sure, but either way Duncan is now coming out with some of the most appealing, yet incomparable work in his 50 year-wide catalogue. Aided by Joachim Nordwall, the pair convene a set of songs every bit as fascinating and eerie as the cover image of a birdcage mask bound in barbed wire. The title track emphasises the stark mystery with nothing more than meditative vocals, gamelan strikes and daubs of shortwave, before ‘Hard Swallow’ catches him huskily channelling Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry at a spooky distance, while the disembodied dub tropes of ’Soft Eyes’ come uncannily close to aspects of Jay Glass Dubs, and ‘Say No’ says it in the bluntest, most bluesy terms. The most desiccated, strung-out material however is saved for the B-side, with the sferic resonance and stereo-strafing vocal of ‘The Joke’ planing out into the cracked hush of ‘The Beautiful Attempt’, before he and Nordwall effectively duet in the finale ‘The Red Hot Alternative’, where Nordwall also supplies pranging percussion and Coil-esque synth abstraction. less"

   "name": "M.GG unfolds an epic, multi-dimensional tapestry of terra-forming electronics ranking among his most vividly abundant and ecologically sound with ‘I Am the Last of That Green and Warm-Hued World’ “I Am The Last of That Green and Warm-Hued World came into existence after M. Geddes Gengras’s father appeared to him in a dream and suggested that he read Stephen King’s The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. The vivid, post-apocalyptic locales visited in the book, which range from mountain ranges to atomic water pumping stations to interdimensional portals, directly inform the auditory spaces that Gengras draws into life with this album. While ambient music often reaches the listener with a host of external signifiers meant to ground the music in some semblance of the physical world (see: oceanic album art, song titles that evoke specific images), Gengras’s music achieves a rare degree of topographical intricacy by virtue of his wide, dense mixes and the contrasting textures presented by his interlocking tiers of synthesis. Over the course of five extended sessions that range from 11 to 22 minutes each, the album sinks into passages of near-complete stasis and crests into segments animated by intermittent bursts of melody and muted, techno-adjacent drum tones, settling into discrete atmospheres that percolate at different degrees of rhythmic complexity. All the while, M. Geddes Gengras allows individual elements to generatively interact and twist around each other to the point that no two moments present the same exact sounds. A far cry from willfully repetitive, loop-based ambient music, I Am The Last of That Green and Warm-Hued World extends before the listener as a fluctuating, self-contained biome, with the components of each composition carefully stacked together and charged with their own trajectory through time and imagined physical space.” less"

   "name": "Nottingham-based composer and multi-instrumentalist Thomas William Hill returns to Village Green with ‘Grains Of Space’, his second album for the label following 2017’s multi-textured ‘Asylum For Eve’. \"‘Grains Of Space’ started life as a series of minimal loops, recorded using a viola da gamba - a stringed instrument most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque eras - and aloop pedal. Using the negative space within each loop as the primary drive for composing, Thomas began a process of ‘joining the dots’, allowing the silence to dictate the next layer, informing the length, pitch and timbre of notes. Using those recordings as the foundation, Thomas began incorporating a wide variety of other instruments into his palette, including bowed metallophones, gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, African kalimbas and metal tongue drums, as well as drum machines and analogue synthesisers. From the tense, opening drones of ‘Carriages’ to sparser, more lyrical works such as ‘Curvature’ and ‘Refract’, Thomas again demonstrates profound compositional insight, crafting highly poignant moments rich with harmony and texture. Complementing this, a more developed sense of pulse and rhythm characterises much of the album, such as the propulsive undertow of ‘Willow’ and the tactile, modernist polyrhythms of ‘Furnace’ and ‘Tongue’. ‘Grains Of Space’ also sees Tom collaborating and cowriting with a number of other musicians, bringing trumpet, violin, double bass and harp together to provide a broad and varied form to each piece.\" less"

Up top he glydes from burnished ambient dub in ‘Purant Chaos Voices’ into the gloomily physical emulation of new age alien sound ecologies in ‘Realm’, and a billowing dub-stepper named ‘Morph 21’. On the flip he swivels the underwater drums of ‘Mt Sonix’ in fathomless layers of subbass, and the keeling heft of ‘Hive Mind’ leads into a sort of splayed, seasick 2-step dub somewhere between Jay Glass Dubs and Pendant to leave you satisfyingly reeling but likely wanting to do it again. less"

Toeplitz, also included on the 2nd disc Marking 20 years of releases under his own name, during which he’s worked extensively at the GRM and notably collaborated with the likes of Eliane Radigue and Phill Niblock, ‘Agitation / Starvation’ forms both an objective and subjective rendering of Kaspar’s latest work, with his original electronic score included for reference against zeitkratzer’s instrumental interpretation. The two pieces are meant to be stand alone, but the CD cover does ate that they can be played simultaneously. On the original electronic score, Toeplitz presents a harsh, abstract gully of free-moving atonalities that erupt with a n often violent nature.

Introducing herself with the quicksand base and barely buoyant whispers of ‘I can’t Remember How I Got Here’, the album continues to induce a deliciously woozy state with amorphous, intimate synth sculpture of ‘Imagined Truth’, while ‘First Morning Out’ dawns suspended organ tones and pitter patter rhythms recalling Felicia Atkinson works. And just as you think you’ve grasped her sound, ‘The Deepest Instinct Is Expressed In Running’ flips the script with a tarry streak of slo-mo darkwave dance music where you almost expect ToC’s Camella Lobo to join in, and fittingly comes followed by the dark post-punk bassline, steepled vocal and creepy chamber atmosphere of ‘Here Warmth Is Transmitted’, with the viscous curdle of her Chris & Cosey-like finale, ‘Nothing Is Changed But Everything Will Alter’ serving to close the first chapter in Joanna John’s quietly promising story. less"

   "name": "Ruggedly diverse dance pressure toggling the meter between deft downstrokes, tribalist percolators, and 4th world cyber vibes compatible with Tolouse Low Trax, Low Jack, Ramzi “Panagiotis Melidis is a singer-songwriter also known as Larry Gus on DFA Records, and Stathis Kalatzis is a techno mainstay formerly known as Mr. Statik. Together they are Territroy, and this spring they release their debut album, Skulls & Plants, on Dekmantel’s UFO label. The duo has a very specific starting point for their music, and that is the AGET Heracles Cement Factory Plant in Volos, Magnisia, Greece: You’re climbing the Goritsa Hill and the moment you get to the top, you look over to the sea view, but the cement factory dominates the landscape. It lays there almost like a window into the future, where nature, corporate ethos, plant and stone based materials and biochemical extensions all exist as one. The factory is a metaphor that processes the land itself, ignites it in a cancerous way then dumps it into the sea and the atmosphere. It’s a combination of all possible scenarios of optimism and negativity, the essence of trying to do the best for everyone, but accidentally killing everyone in the process. That contrasting duality is mirrored in Territroy. Each half comes from two separate worlds: graphic novels vs illustration, literature vs empty pages, the functionality and the sheer craft of sculpting sound into feeling vs taking that feeling and analysing it until it no longer exists. More simply put, it is a sports field that is a basketball court at one side and a football pitch at the other, but somehow everyone finds a way to play the same sport, even though one uses his hands and the other his feet. When one half of Territroy starts a phrase, the other one finishes it, but they speak different languages, and will never be sure if the finished sentence is technically correct, even though they can be certain that it’s definitely finished. What ties them is a constant rhythmic element that is persistent and comes from growing up in Greece and absorbing the rhythmic specificities of Southern Europe and unique Mediterranean attitudes. Importantly, there is also a lot that separates the pair. The result is music that brings together two very different personalities and perspectives but allows them both to coexist, intertwine and unfold in untold new ways.” less"

He discusses the chord, its notes and their disposition, but what haunts him is a “particular sonority.” A sonority is the product of physical action on physical materials: the instruments, the registers in which they are activated, the breath of the musicians, the waveforms thus produced, their merging and interfering, and finally the moment and place of these actions.

The brackets can be fixed (e.g. from 1.15 to 2.00) or flexible (e.g. from anywhere between 1.15 and 1.45, and to anywhere between 2.00 and 2.30), allowing form myriad subtle variations on the same themes. In the case of ‘One’ there are 10 time brackets, all flexible except for the ninth./ Each contains music written onto staves, but the content of one staff can be played in any relation with that of the other staff. Guy Vandromme offers two calmly spare 10 minute versions of ‘One’, which, if we’re honest, sound pretty much identical, but do actually differ from each other. There’s also a 20 minute version of ‘One5’ (his fifth work for one player) which has a more complex set of instructions including 21 time brackets for the left hand and 24 for the right. Each contains a single chord or a single note, and the performer is instructed to either hold the pedal throughout, or make as many overlappings as possible (again, using the pedal if necessary). The final piece is very quiet, often tending to the lowest registers of the keyboard and allowing the notes to spread out, smeared into a gently undulating late night panorama. less"

   "name": "A total must-have for sound-oriented cinephiles! This is the first ever pressing of David Shire’s OST for ‘The Conversation’, a Francis Ford Coppola classic about a wire-tapper in 1970’s NYC, brilliantly played by Gene Hackman, and featuring sound design by the living legend Walter Murch. Trust Jonny Trunk to execute the job with typically covetable results. Like Jonny Trunk, we distinctly remember seeing this flick for the first time in the ‘90s (probably late on a schoolnight on Channel 4 in my case) and becoming utterly sucked into the film’s innovative shots and sound design, which uniquely told the story of a wire-tapper, brusquely portrayed as a Mac-wearing and neurotic loner by Gene Hackman, who memorably unravels when, on his latest job, he uncovers a murder. Even to our naif ‘90s ears, the by-then-vintage movie soundtrack and its subtly innovative sound design felt uncannily sparse and refreshing, especially for a major studio production, and it’s not hard to understand how it’s been referenced as a genre classic countless times since then. With hindsight, we can hear how it dovetails very neatly with the minimalist and avant-garde movements of the ‘70s, arguably in the process becoming a sterling example of the way avant-garde and mainstream ideas fluidly informed each other in that decade. The music is mostly played on piano by David Shire, who was enlisted for his first ever soundtrack job by his brother-in-law, Francis Ford Coppola. The main theme is a sort of slow ragtime jazz piece which filters thru the whole soundtrack, returning in increasingly tense and prangingly dissonant avant-garde situations that mirror the narrative’s flow of intrigue and tension. It’s not until the 5th track, ‘To The Office/The Elevator’ when this element arrives in the soundtrack, and it only really happens again in a small handful of other instances, but the contrast is so stealthy and subtle that it gets us every time, and works beautifully in balance with the airy, pensive, isolated economy of David Shire’s other pieces in the soundtrack. less"

This is his 2nd recording for Edition Wandelweiser Records after 2016’s ‘Be Nothing.’ Until we got used to his steez by the end of titular opener, ’One Dimensional’, we genuinely weren’t sure if the CD was cutting out or if he suffered from a form of Narcolepsy or self-induced hypoxia (shortage of oxygen to the brain) from his concentrated tekkers.

It was originally recorded in 1971 as the followup to their near-mythical 'Feed-back' session of 1970 - copies of which change hands for over $1000 - and is actually considered its superior by those in the know... That dream team comprised the then in-demand soundtrack composer Morricone, plus an experienced, attuned line-up of Battisti D'Amario, Egisto Macchi, Franco Evangelista, Mario Bertoncini, and Walter Branchi, who between them were responsible for a wealth of work, from classic Italian soundtracks to more academic pursuits in sound theory and experimental electronics. T hey draw deeply and instinctively upon those varied disciplines across 'Niente', from the brain-teasing stereo separation cleft to their ultra-cool consideration of atmosphere and groove, and taste for \"new consonance\" influenced by the studies of Luigi Nono or Giacinto Scelsi. Powered by dry, motorik breaks, the album spans 16 segments ranging from a six minute introductory piece to short but killer cues, almost always with a sophisticated reserve, but also with a psychedelic funk and avant edge perilously threatening to boil over.

It is their most unabashedly beautiful album yet, showcasing the elegant phrasing of Wadada Leo Smith on trumpet and Evan Parker on Saxophone, accompanied by John Edwards' meaty and textural bass playing and the sensitive drumming of Mark Sanders. The album clearly reveals the evolution that resulted from Spring Heel Jack's 2003 UK tour, which allowed them to realize their electroacoustic free jazz vision in a more spontaneous setting. Not only does The Sweetness of the Water sound more live and intimate, it also displays a fully developed compositional sensibility, with a muted, meditative atmosphere that results from the masterful Spring Heel Jack production touch. John Coxon's guitar figures heavily, providing a rough juxtaposition to the delicate playing of Smith and Parker. Slow, delicate chord progressions provide the backbone for focused, introspective improvisation.

The narrative revolves themes such as the Shinto religion, the tea ceremony, the history of whaling, and the supplantation of blubber with refined petroleum for oil, all rendered in Barney’s peerless imagery and attention to detail. Björk was famously partnered to Matthew Barney between 2000-2013, and her ‘Vulnicura’ [2015] album is about their breakup.

Rather, she was heavily involved with the production and performance, roping in figures such as Akira Rabelais, Bedroom Community-Founder Valgeir Sigurdsson, Mark Bell aka LFO, Leila, Zeena Parkins, Nico Muhly and and a Japanese children’s choir to help her accentuate the film’s striking look. less"

If you don’t like this check out Holly Herndon’s ‘Proto’ album, and vice-versa “Technology was meant to be humanity’s tool to combat famine, disease, confusion, and to facilitate life, culture, and innovation. Instead, we’re mired in a digital labyrinth that few care to navigate or even solve. Perhaps it’s not a ruse and the matrices coded by keyboard maestros are a path to liberation, but without querying the constructs we cannot ruminate on their affectations on humanity. VR SEX are audio/visual provocateurs who transpose the identifiers of death rock, synth punk, post-punk, ambient, and ethereal soundscapes into an audit on technology and its imprint on our collective psyche. Comprised of visionary mercenaries Noel Skum (Andrew Clinco of Drab Majesty), Z. Oro (Aaron Montaigne of Antioch Arrow/Heroin/DBC) on vocals and drums, and Mico Frost (Brian Tarney) on synths and electric bass. Their debut tome, Human Traffic Jam, focuses on lyrical themes that probe the possibilities of loss of autonomy through social media, the decline of human interaction, and celebrity favoritism. Skum believes in the stabilization of society and preservation of our planet by reducing its amount of procreators. Through PSRS or Procreation Simulation Reproduction Stimulation, humans can act on their hedonistic desires and not face the responsibilities and consequences that come with being an ill-prepared guardian. The future of our offspring will exist in virtual realms and population growth in turn will be stabilized. VR SEX is the cure to most societal ills. Thematically condensed into an eight song album, Human Traffic Jam was written and demoed by Skum in a flat in Athens, Greece during the winter of 2017. During a rigorous week long session at Figure 8 studios with experimental and dimensional production extraordinaire Ben Greenberg (Uniform/The Men), Skum solely committed all the instrumentation present on Human Traffic Jam. Rather than being emblematic of influences, each song on the LP infuses a dire tension that cuts shimmer with fetid frequencies, never establishing an aural hierarchy or urgency. Instead, we’re lead into punchy capsules of “dour pop”; the balance of saccharine and sour so emblematic of the VR SEX hive mind.” less"

Revolving mainman Nigel Ayers and Caroline K in this iteration of Nocturnal Emissions (only shortly before it became a one-man vehicle for Ayers), their sound is firmly lodged between what were then the arguably, mutually exclusive stylistic bedfellows of grotty electronics and swaggering grooves. Nowadays you can’t shake a shitty stick for fear of hitting this kind of music, but back then this sound was uncommon and offroad, and shared by a small pool of artists including SPK, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Tackhead and Hula. It’s perhaps testament to the tenacity and prescience of Nocturnal Emissions’ vision that these trax still sound so fresh, as it took the mainstream and everyone else a few years to catch up, but they’ve evidently still never quite gotten over it, as a large section of contemporary dancefloors still can’t shake the styles of highlights such as the fudge funk of ‘Suffering Stinks’, the alien budge of ‘Going Under’, and the salty swagger of ‘No Separation’. less"

   "name": "The first ever live performance and recording by Marc Moulin’s sought-after jazz-funk band Placebo, captured at Casino Kursaal during the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1971 and never released before. \"June 17th, 1971, the Montreux Riviera, its delightful microclimate and postcard scenery, its fabled music history and the luscious wines of the region. A dream setting for Marc Moulin to lead his ensemble on a 26 minutes+ jazz adventure - Nick Kletchkovsky on bass, Freddy Rottier on drums, Johnny Dover on bass clarinet, Alex Scorier on soprano saxophone, and Richard Rousselet on flugelhorn. The magic of that night is dripping through Placebo’s sumptuous \"Showbiz Suite\", a soulful piece in two parts in which every instrument gets enough room to shine, smoothly navigating between cozy cognac-by-the-fireplace funk and heartfelt grittiness, served with a pinch of Soft Machine vibes. It’s the night Placebo was born, when foundations were laid for three classic albums: Ball of Eyes (on which you can hear a shorter studio version of \"Showbiz Suite\"), 1973, and their final self-titled album. Born in 1942 in Ixelles, the multifaceted Marc Moulin had one of the most fascinating careers in the history of Belgian music, from his jazz roots and Placebo to founding electronic disco pop band Telex (\"Moskow Diskow\", \"Rock Around The Clock\"…), producing a vast array of French and Belgian hits (notably for Philip Catherine and Lio), pioneering downtempo and electro jazz with three albums on Blue Note, and exploring other avenues of expression such a radio hosting and comedy.

Without a doubt one of the most daring artists out there right now, Klein makes music acutely symptomatic of its era. Naturally, recklessly combining formerly mutually exclusive styles such as gospel and noise, or ambient collage and R&B, she somehow keeps a distinct aesthetic amid these dense expressions of modernity, cannily reflecting the normalisation of intensifying socio-economic anxieties and the inexorable drive of urban life within her navigations of chaotic sonic environments. Forging sounds and styles as wild as anything from Bob Ostertag’s ‘DJ Of The Month’, or with the decentred intensity of Aaron Dilloway, Klein’s music is better distinguished by the way she effortlessly bridges dimensions and conjures whole new sensations for the listener to deal with. I mean, if you’re on this site, you’re probably familiar with both Hype Williams and Prurient, but like us, you’d probably struggle to think of another artist who sounds like both of them at the same time, and in that sense Klein’s music is neologistic, syncretic and blessed with an intuitive physics in a way that language and musical perception is only catching up with. Yet it’s best received and deciphered with a red 3rd eye and porous 6th sense, cos any attempt to limn it in concrete, literal terms will never fully grasp its emotive chicanery and might dull its aura of outright, alien oddness. less"

Instead Thatcher pacified the working classes by selling off Government owned housing stock and duly trampled on the miners, ripping away their livelihood. Today we have minors striking against the use of fossil fuel. What went around doesn’t necessarily come back around. But the experience left Nocturnal Emissions with fuel for their fire. Applying hardware skill gleaned over the prior five years, they made music for rabble rousing that didn’t rely on the usual punk formulas, resulting massive tunes in the fast and frazzled gob of ‘No Sacrifice (In Love and Revolution)’ and the timeless, magisterial sashay of ’Never Give Up’ with its unmistakeable synth melody by Caroline K. Nigel Ayers says: \"The Miners’ Strike was on and there were riots down our street in Brixton. I was convinced there was going to be a revolution. But it would probably have been quite unpleasant. All these old punks and hippies preaching revolution, I don’t think we were really prepared to live with the consequences. If we actually had a revolution in this country, it would be like Iraq or something, or Syria. But we were having horrible times with Thatcher.

Part two will follow in a years time and will turn its attention to the night sky and constellations. A Porthole continues astrïd’s signature style of billowing guitars, strings and woodwind. Each element intertwined with another, linked perfectly together through restrained jazz-tinged percussion. 2017’s highly-acclaimed release ‘Through the Sparkle’ with renowned pianist Rachel Grimes (of Rachels) set the bar extremely high for this release but astrïd have matched the depth, melody and quality of that record here. Part one of this journey features some sublime compositions with Cyril Secq’s expressive and bold guitar playing carrying the pieces into chamber music territory, joined seamlessly by a variety of other instruments that swell and soar and fit perfectly into the story being told. Everything seems to have its place, nothing is overplayed or out of step here, there is an organic nature to the way this quartet plays and interacts with one another as melodies circle back and fade away in the same beautiful breath.

Mueller then added his particular, signature brand of intricate, hypnotic percussion to the mix and the compositions began to grow and take shape. The pair agreed that the pieces needed a more human touch and Coloccia was invited onboard, contributing processed vocals via looping, tape manipulation and microphone feedback.

   "name": "Deaf Center's second album Owl Splinters from 2011 gets a lavish re-packaging as a gatefold 2LP. It includes a Svarte Greiner re-interpretation album ‘Twin' as well as new cover-art with photos by cinematographer Joshua Zucker-Pluda. Erik Skodvin and Otto Totland quietly honed their art via the nightmarish catharsis of the Svarte Greiner and Nest projects respectively, arriving at their 2nd album together ‘Owl Splinters’ back in 2011 in deeply solemn and contemplative mood. For this chapter of their story, mysterious imagery was rendered even sharper, as though someone on the inside wiped a palm on the window of their cabin in the woods. This is largely attributable to the fact it was recorded at Nils Frahms' Durton studio, where the lo-fi graininess and techniques of their early work was brought to life with hi-end engineering and analogue equipment, allowing the duo to articulate their supernatural stories with more evocative detailing and widescreen atmospherics. Opening to the bowed strings and seismic bass shudder of 'Divided', we're ushered straight to a world where Totland's piano adorns centrepiece 'The Day I Would Never Have' with ethereal pensiveness and Skodvin's cello expands like a dense, blackened cloud of smoke. Through the smaller vingettes like 'Fiction Dawn', this forested gloom colours the album through to the slow, vacuous pressure system of 'Close Forever Watching', its surge of cold black air almost brutally resolving the atmospheric tension. The accompanying LP ‘Twin' is a 40 minute interpretation of Owl Splinters by Erik K Skodvin under his Svarte Greiner alias. The record takes the long-form, ghostly sections of it's parent album and expands them into crushing drone epics. The two parts are cut into four sections, pieced together by used and unused material from the recording session. It first appeared in form of an accompaniement CD that came with the initial 100 LPs of Owl Splinters. This is the first time ‘Twin' appears on vinyl. less"

   "name": "Abul Mogard's first new solo album since 2015’s ‘Circular Forms’, a staggering suite of widescreen landscapes painted in self-built modular synth strokes. Hugely recommended if you're into Alessandro Cortini, early OPN, Coil, Brian Eno... Above All Dreams is Abul Mogard’s beautifully absorbing new album for Ecstatic, deploying six longform pieces for the most expansive solo release by Mogard to date. Taking into account its intangible divinity and cinematic quality - the result of no less than three years diligent work - it is arguably elevated to the level of his master opus; presenting a modular distillation of Mogard’s most intoxicating strain of hauntology. Consistent with Mogard’s music since the sought-after VCO tapes c. 2012-2013, the allure to Above All Dreams lies in his ability to evoke and render feelings which are perhaps purposefully avoided in more academic echelons of drone music. Rather than a purist expression of physics thru maths and geometry, Mogard voices his soul, improvising on modular synth for hours, days, months and years in the same way a more conventional “band” develops group intuition. While hands-on, the intuitive evolution of process locates a newfound freedom in his music that implies a recognition of the metaphysical or post-physical, while Mogard explicitly points to influence from the Brazilian music of Tom Zé, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Chico Buarque, whose approach to shape and density, or perceptions of light and delicacy, also go some way to explaining the ephemeral intangibility of Above All Dreams. The results are best considered as the ephemera of non-verbal communications. From the gaseous bloom of Quiet Dreams to the opiated depth of Where Not Even to the starlit awn of Upon The Smallish Circulation, and through the B-side’s keeling, 16 minute+ panoramas of Above All Dreams and The Roof Falls, the power of Abul Mogard’s dreams above all transcends sound, feeling and physics in a truly remarkable way that evades words or concrete notation. less"

In nine original productions plus a Cardopusher remix and a Powermoves megamix, they absolutely take the skin off it with a wild-eyed and ruthless barrage of hi-impact heavyweights. They’re not necessarily remaking the wheel, but we haven’t heard this sound executed with so much gnashing energy and style in years. Trust it’s no piss-weak revivalism or slap-a-tinny-break-on-it dilettantism, but the real fucking thing, ravenous and ravishing, chomping at the bit, not hanging in the smoking area cos it’s actually shit inside, where everyone’s going thru the motions, waiting for a good tune. ‘InDreams’ is rave techno as punk music inspired by sci-fi literature and cinema. It’s highly visual stuff, connoting imagery of cenobites at Thunderdome, darkroom chase scenes and dancers pushing themselves to exhaustion between massive highlights in the hard acid trance peak of ‘InDreams’, the mentasmic gush of ‘L.A.P.’, and the lockjaw scally bounce of ‘June Anthem’ or the clattering skullduggery of ‘Persuasive Behaviour’. Sometimes, it’s hard for us to reconcile first hand experience of older raves, when folk were far less self-conscious and more up-for-it, with many of rave’s current iterations, but ‘InDreams’ is the kind of record that could bring the joy of utter, unbuttoned abandonment back to the centre of the ‘floor.

   "name": "Akira Rabelais’ supremely moving eisoptrophobia album issued on vinyl for the first time, 17 years after it was first released on CD. Harnessing Akira’s own smudged recollections of childhood brought to life via treated solo piano pieces by Erik Satie and Bartok, it’s a haunting mutation of sound that comes hugely recommended if you grabbed his peerless Spellewauerynsherde reissue last year, or indeed any of his releases for David Sylvian’s Samadhisound label. Followers of The Caretaker’s work or Stephan Mathieu’s classic 'Radioland' album should also dive deep into these exquisite, bittersweet memories of secret histories lost in time. First released in 2001 on CD by Ritornell, a sub-label of Mille Plateaux, ‘eisoptrophobia’ was an early iteration of Akira applying his Argeïphontes Lyre software to classical music, opening a fascinating schism between the original object and his modern, subjective perspective in the process. Made up of spellbinding, uniquely decayed renderings of solo piano pieces, it forms a poetic farewell to the 20th century and a reluctant embrace of new technological possibilities. The original piano recordings of Satie and Bartók pieces were made at Wave Equation Studios in Hollywood, California, and subsequently transformed by Argeïphontes Lyre with beautifully elusive results. The recognisable melodies here ring out in myriad new ways, sometimes fractured and indented by patinas of crackle that echo the original contours, while, at othere, smudged into mind-bending obfuscation or spectral, timbral thizz. They have the uncanny capacity to resemble exhumed artefacts, dug up after decades of decay, and riddled with potently psychedelic mycelium ready to spore on the listener’s mind. But they also capture that elusive yearning for early life; the distant crackle of AM radio playing in another room, scratched records, a piano playing, somehere. The title eisoptrophobia itself means ”fear of mirrors“, in an interview with L.A. weekly back in 2002, Rabelais explained that he picked it as a way of articulating his dread of limitation. ”I exist in a much larger space than what I am physically. But if I were to look into the mirror, I would suddenly pull back into my body.” A feeling not unlike the experience of sitting through this remarkable album before suddenly being snapped back to your surroundings. less"

   "name": "Prolific cellist and composer Lucy Railton releases her long awaited solo debut for Modern Love; an intense and multi-layered opus that reminds us of everything from Alvin Lucier, Beatrice Dillon and Nate Young, to Valerio Tricoli and Popol Vuh. A prolific performer who has appeared on countless recordings and collaborations with many important figures in contemporary music over the last few years, Paradise 94 is, remarkably, Railton's solo debut - featuring archival, location and studio recordings which serve as a time capsule of all the myriad disciplines and influences that have brought her to this point in time. It both plays up to and shatters expectations of her music, which harnesses a duality of energies - acoustic/electronic, real/imagined, iconic/iconoclastic, pissed-off/romantic; out of place and androgynous - resulting in a visceral emotional insight and rare narrative grasp. Variegated, asymmetric, and located somewhere between her usual fields of exploration, Paradise 94 gives free reign to aspects of her creativity that have previously been subsumed into collaborative processes and interpretations of other composers’ work. Here, she’s free to probe, sculpt and layer her sounds through a much broader range of techniques and strategies, placing particular focus on non-linear structural arrangements and exploring the way her cello becomes perceptibly synthetic through collaging, rather than FX. At every turn Paradise 94 is bewilderingly unique. The A-side unfolds an oneiric, inception-like sequence traversing temporalities, timbres and tones from what sounds like a spectral ensemble playing on a traffic island in Pinnevik, to bursts of rabbit-in-headlights trance arps emerging from meticulously dissected musique concrète in The Critical Rush, and a collision of masked vocals, string eruptions and a deeply moving, light-headed Bach rendition in For J.R. On the other hand, Fortified Up on side B tests out a far rawer approach, sampling herself playing the same glissandi over and again, which she layers into a sort of perpetual, sickly motion, the Shepard Tone riffing on the listener’s psychoacoustic perceptions before calving off into a cathartic dissonant folk coda in its final throes. In the most classic sense, you can only properly begin to f*ck with something from the inside once you truly know it. Railton’s dedicated years of service have more than equipped her with the nous and skill to do just that, gifting us with what will no doubt be looked back on as a raw, exposed and important solo debut in years to come. Additional Note: The album features Beatrice Dillon on acetone drums on 'To The End', Gard Nilssen on cymbals and glass samples recorded and provided by Nicolas Becker on ‘The Critical Rush’. Organ extract on 'For J.R.' (Erbarm dich mein, o Herre Gott) is composed by J.S. Bach and performed by Kit Downes, drain pipe is performed by Koichi Makigami. less"

   "name": "A tragically overlooked part of the ‘70s avant-classical canon finally appears on vinyl with Blume’s pressing of Julius Eastman’s ‘Crazy Nigger’ - the first part of his seminal ‘Nigger Series’ including ‘Gay Guerrilla’ and ‘Evil Nigger’, which were all previously only available on the sought-after ‘Unjust Malaise’ 3CD compilation Julius Eastman (1940-1990) was a prodigious voice within the influential American avant-classical movement of the 1970s. As a composer, pianist, Grammy-nominated vocalist and dancer he brought unique qualities to the downtown minimalist movement most commonly associated with Philip Glass and Steve Reich. But where their music has received no shortage of accolades, by the early ‘80s Eastman’s staggering compositional contributions during the same era were practically unknown beyond tapes circulated between his peers. As Bradford Bailey explains “His place within the context of American classical music - an uncompromising artist of inconvenient identity, rising on the tide of an unavoidable talent, was a threat to the institution’s walls. It’s no surprise that his efforts were forced into the shadows…” With thanks to Mary Jane Leach, however, a wider reappraisal of Eastman’s work began with release of his ‘Nigger Series’ as part of the 3CD ‘Unjust Malaise’ [New World Records, 2005], and the trio of works now appear on vinyl for the first time. ‘Crazy Nigger’ is the first and longest part of the series’. Its provocative title was shocking then and is perhaps now more than ever. However, as the composer explains in an introduction given at Northwestern University found on ‘Unjust Malaise’, his use of the term is anything but derogatory, instead referring to the fundamental role of “field niggers” in the foundation of the American economy, as “not superficial, but elegant… at the ground of things”. From this perceptive base, Julius Eastman radically adapts the instrumental language of classical music to his own, expressive ends, to challenge the restrictions of romantic classical music with more fluid and organically open-ended musical structures. Composed in 1978, ‘Crazy Nigger’ offers a muscular parallel to the more mannered minimalism of the era. His keys attack in powerful flurries right from the start, cascading complex harmonies that arguably feel more immediate, gloriously voluminous and, heck, “crazed” than work by almost any of his contemporaries. By the track’s hammering climax and lofted conclusion, first time listeners will be under little illusion as to the thrilling power of Eastman’s playing and vision. It could be said that the difference in Eastman’s music stems from his personal experience as flamboyant, Gay, Black man in the ’70s. Like his contemporary Arthur Russell (he notably conducted Russell’s ‘Tower of Meaning’ and sang on Dinosaur L’s ‘24→24 Music’) and the efforts of Glass and Reich, Eastman’s music unavoidably mirrors the drive of disco and the sprawling fluidity of African music, bridging dimensions in dizzying flights of innovation. But where Reich and Glass are often hailed as forerunners of a certain type of mannered minimal techno, then by that logic, Eastman’s music is a kind of prototype for the breathtaking, headlong rush of Detroit or NYC techno and hardcore for discerning listeners. And as for the title, perhaps Bradford Bailey puts it best: “You have to wonder, when titling his works - often deploying the vile language of racism and homophobia, if Julius Eastman was consciously forcing white, leftist music fans like myself to choke out words which we actively despise - to recognise polarising truths which are bound to his sounds and the context in which they reside - to see our complicity with unforgivable sin.\" less"

   "name": "Rotherham rave imp Rian Treanor kicks up to Planet Mu for ‘Ataxia’, his debut album following introductory EPs with The Death of Rave and Warp’s resuscitated Arcola sublabel. Under the title ‘ATAXIA’, chosen literally for its meaning - “the loss of control of bodily movements” - as well as its figurative, asymmetric quality, Rian sequences ramped versions of his tracks for The Death of Rave along with shockingly forward new gear that plays into his love of Dadaist vocal cut-ups. The result is an immensely playful and beguiling album, cannily messing with listeners’ sense of rhythmic anticipation in a dare-to-be-different style that’s tripped up and put a big daft grin on dancefloors everywhere from Boiler Room in Helsinki to Uganda’s Nyege Nyege Tapes festival. Where his earlier EPs were mostly improvised, Rian spent more time shaping the tracks for ‘ATAXIA’. Taking cues from his mentor and father, eminent sound artist Mark Fell, as well a rich SoYo rave heritage, he sticks to an economical palette, making each stab, drum and pad count in the democracy of the mix. From these relatively simple, if now more refined elements, Rian’s suss comes into play in the structuring, using his background as a visual artist to create disruptive patterns of angular yet fluid syncopation and irregular symmetries that both allow for and connote a sort of hyper-natural order of chaos. While resembling the styles of speed garage, synth-pop, bleep techno and extreme computer music that he grew up with, Rian’s pointedly mischievous approach jumbles those styles, using the tactility of Max/MSP to rejig them with more unpredictable and playfully wrong-footing effect, embracing the dancefloor’s radical potential to reprogram minds and bodies. Concepts aside, though, ‘ATAXIA’ is a lot of fun. Rian’s dry Yorkshire humour is in full effect in the cut-up vocals of the openings and closing numbers, while the recursive ballistics of ‘B1’ are bound to tie bodies in knots, ‘C2’ advances his absorbingly intricate melodic sequencing, and the rhymelodic chicanery of ‘D2’ ranks among the most stunning, inexorably funky cuts in his catalogue. less"

   "name": "’Evil Nigger’ and ’Gay Guerilla’ complete the first vinyl cycle of Julius Eastman’s breathtaking ‘Nigger Series’ [1978-79] for the Blume label. Previously only available in the ‘Unjust Malaise’ 3CD, along with ‘Crazy Nigger’ they collectively testify to a true genius who died before his work was given wider recognition. This set should help to bend the timeline of ‘70s avant-classical and minimalist music back to one of its most important composers. Julius Eastman (1940-1990) was a prodigious voice within the influential American avant-classical movement of the 1970s. As a composer, pianist, Grammy-nominated vocalist and dancer he brought unique qualities to the downtown minimalist movement most commonly associated with Philip Glass and Steve Reich. But where their music has received no shortage of accolades, by the early ‘80s Eastman’s staggering compositional contributions during the same era were practically unknown beyond tapes circulated between his peers. As Bradford Bailey explains “His place within the context of American classical music - an uncompromising artist of inconvenient identity, rising on the tide of an unavoidable talent, was a threat to the institution’s walls. It’s no surprise that his efforts were forced into the shadows…” With thanks to Mary Jane Leach, however, a wider reappraisal of Eastman’s work began with release of his ‘Nigger Series’ as part of the 3CD ‘Unjust Malaise’ [New World Records, 2005], and the trio of works now appear on vinyl for the first time. Both ’Evil Nigger’ and ’Gay Guerilla’ are half the length of ‘Crazy Nigger’, but pack just as much thrilling information as the preceding piece. Again, their provocative titles refer directly to Eastman’s experience as a flamboyantly Gay, Black man working within an ostensibly open-minded, but often bigoted avant-classical music network. Effectively speaking truth to power, and with power, their titles should also be taken in context of a time when Richard Pryor’s ‘That Nigger’s Crazy’ and ‘Bicentennial Nigger’ and Patti Smith’s ‘Rock N Roll Nigger’ were equally challenging the status quo, grasping the issue by the thorns. ‘Evil Nigger’ follows suit from ‘Crazy Nigger’ with heart-racing intensity and blistering pace, with its four pianists, including Eastman, urged into spiralling frenzies by Eastman’s cries of “two, three, four”, while the piece escalates from tonal to multi-tonal colour with imperceptibly naturalistic quality, then decays into ether. ‘Gay Guerilla’ follows, relaxing the tension to connote a sense of the sublime, attempting to model in his music an empathy or kinship between downtrodden Gay and Black folk, and the PLO or Afghan army; people who were prepared to shed blood for what they believe in. The piece finds a devastating power in its relative reserve to the other two parts, with a finer, slower narrative quality pivoting around a musical quote from the Martin Luther hymn ‘A Mighty Fortress is Our God’, dramatically, and perhaps subversively, implying a call to arms. It is a tragic fact that Julius Eastman died aged 49, just over 10 years after these totemic pieces were written and premiered. In the time between, his work was neglected and his genius overlooked to the extent that he fell into substance addiction, eventually losing his accommodation and with it the vast majority of his scores and recordings. He would eventually make his way to Buffalo, New York, where he died aged 49. It would be at least 15 years before his music became known and available again, with Mary Jane Leach posting his remaining, scores to the internet, leading to subsequent performances by ensembles across the world, and important reappraisals of his work by Black Music scholars such Jace Clayton and Kodwo Eshun. less"

While patently acid techno in form and style, on Acid Mt.

Low Distance’ returns Erik Skodvin and Otto A. Totland to the shadowy, wintry depths of their early sound, seemingly sequestered in a loft or creaking wooden house in a place where the sun doesn’t rise for 6 months of the year. Their signature palette of ghostly piano gestures, glacial but knife-edge strings and electronics is employed to expectedly beautiful effect, but it’s perhaps the final mixing treatment, uncannily rendered along vertical and horizontal axes at EMS Stockholm, that really brings this record to life, just as integrally as lighting is to a slow burn film noir. Endearingly working on low batteries throughout the album, their sense of melancholy is patently apparent and deeply intoxicating with it, diffused through the synaesthetic connotations of rain in ‘A Scent’, and through the clammy skin stroking strings of ‘Entity Voice’ before sublimely relieving tension with ‘Undone’. They then broach more textured, abstract electro-acoustic space in the spectral flocking of ‘Gathering’, the album’s extended centrepiece, before touching on midnight jazz notes, sumptuous subs and extended techniques in ‘Red Glow’ like some meeting of Deathprod and Bohren Und Der Club of Gore, and the barely there yet heartbreaking strings of ‘Faded Earth’ attest to their preternatural skill in getting the most from the barest components. The last section is just immensely powerful in its stark vulnerability and impending tension, holding its emotive line thru the needling hi-register keys and heavy-breathing strings of ‘Movements/The Ascent’, thru the lingering romance of ‘Far Between’, until the quietly jaw-dropping, beautiful solo piano resolution of ‘Yet To Come’, where the hallucinatory nature dissipates and we’re left with starkly vivid, waking realism implied by the track’s title. less"

Marking up their first LP proper since 2016’s brilliant ‘All Kind Music’, Close and Tripp return with a crisply enhanced psychedelic keen and temporal slip to their sound after testing this looser form on various tapes and EP's over the past 18 months. Across the 13 tracks of ‘Time’ they inimitably work within this framework to develop a polymetric swerve and style of colouring-outside-the-lines that uniquely acknowledges traditional African tribal musics in the same breath as Footwork, Singeli, and the beat-freaking suss of Don’t DJ or Rian Treanor; It’s hyper-jazz, free-techno, and 4.1-world musique concrète simultaneously. Cutting around the everything-at-once flatlands of modern culture’s prevailing reference points, they dare to imagine and weave previously impossible texture/patterns, placing their finely-honed graphic designers’ sensibilities at the service of visually-stimulating sonic arrangements rife with clashes of colour and non-standard tunings bent and twysted in devilish, unsteady meters. But make no mistake, this isn’t some experiment in chucking it all in and seeing what sticks; each track tells a distinct, illusive tale that adds up the album’s strange, immersive story about a parallel dimension very similar to our own, but where things happen and move a bit differently.

   "name": "Wonderful suite of archival gamelan minimalism from Bay Area practitioner Daniel Schmidt. Recital dip into the personal archives of Daniel Schmidt, an integral scholar in the development of American Gamelan. After studying Javanese gamelan at California Institute of the Arts in the early ‘70s, Schmidt set about creating a West Coast movement based around an aluminium version of the instrument – the Berkeley Gamelan - forged of his own design. He’s since gone on to build numerous gamelan instruments, theorise on it’s compositional qualities, collaborate with Lou Harrison, Jody Diamond, and Paul Dresher, and currently teaches at Mills College San Francisco. ‘In My Arms, Many Flowers’ captures the American Gamelan movement in its nascent state, the result of a personal invitation for Recital boss Sean McCann to rifle through three boxes of Schmidt’s studio and live recordings committed to cassette between the late ’70s and early ‘80s. What’s immediately striking here is how Schmidt deviates from the traditional Javanese style of gamelan composition, instead seeking out the minimalist movement of North America for guidance. Making use of a primitive sampler borrowed from Pauline Oliveros (RIP), lead track And the Darkest Hour is Just Before Dawn pairs a sumptuous looped string arrangement with Schmidt’s delicate caresses of the Berkeley Gamelan which build with quiet melodic complexity into something quite wonderful. The title track sees Schmidt augmenting the mysticism of his Berkeley with the bowed strings of a rebab, another traditional Indonesian instrument, deployed to signify a bird that “calls from far away.” Ghosts is one of two compositions done solely with the gamelan, Schmidt leading a procession of players using traditional techniques on a detailed 14-minute recording of percussive dexterity and intricacy that highlights the spiritual powers of the instrument. Faint Impressions offers a sombre finale, the ringing melodicism of the Berkeley gamelan set to a backdrop of an understandably captivated audience. Stunning. less"

The essence of BIG | BRAVE's magic has always been the way they balance these dynamics, and particularly how much sheer power comes from the beautifully quiet moments. \"The same principles are the starting point for the new album, only the approach is different, beginning with the question \"How do we take very little and make something bigger than what we actually have?\" vocalist and guitarist Robin Wattie explains further \"the biggest challenge was to not do what is easiest. i.e. what we knew worked for the last albums or what is, for us, easy to write. With A Gaze Among Them, Mathieu and I put ourselves through the ringer - I did not want to do what seemed to me to be a ‘logical next step’ in what we could do musically. I wanted to go back to our original concepts and work from there - space, tension, minimalism and voice (finding melody and musicality in pieces that consist of one note for longer than ten minutes, for example) were the primary concentrations I wanted to push.\" In the process of revisiting their early intentions, BIG | BRAVE have boldly evolved, emerging with a thrilling new body of work that is all at once refreshingly new, explosively heavy, dynamically loud, beautifully minimal, carefully repetitive, and totally and utterly cathartic. A Gaze Among Them features Robin Wattie (vocals, electric guitar, guitar amp, bass amp), Mathieu Ball (electric guitar, guitar amps) and Loel Campbell (drums) with guest appearances from Thierry Amar (Godspeed You!

With one eye on her background in East Tennessee, and the other tracking a future where A.I. aren’t feared but integrated into society, ‘Proto’ is heavily focussed on the voice, both Holly’s own, that of Spawn, and also 16 guests including Stine Janvin, Colin Self and Annie Garlin, in a fusion of folk-wise, hymnal arrangements rendered with computerised tunings. As you can see from the massive list of guest contributors, the hi-def glossy artwork, and an “emphasis on alien songcraft” and existential questioning of “who we are, what are we, what do we stand for, and what are we heading towards?”, a lot of time, thought and effort has gone into this one... \"Holly’s third full-length album ‘PROTO’ isn’t about AI but much of it was created in collaboration with her own AI ‘baby’, Spawn. For the album, she assembled a contemporary ensemble of vocalists, developers and an inhuman intelligence housed in a DIY souped-up gaming PC to create a record that encompasses live vocal processing and timeless folk singing and places an emphasis on alien song craft and new forms of communion. ‘PROTO’ makes reference to what Holly refers to as the protocol era, where rapidly surfacing ideological battles over the future of AI protocols, centralised and decentralised internet protocols and personal and political protocols compel us to ask ourselves who are we, what are we, what do we stand for and what are we heading towards? You can hear traces of Spawn throughout the album - developed in partnership with longtime collaborator Mathew Dryhurst and ensemble developer Jules LaPlace - and even eavesdrop on the live training ceremonies conducted in Berlin, in which hundreds of people were gathered to teach Spawn how to identify and reinterpret unfamiliar sounds in group call-and-response singing sessions; a contemporary update on the religious gathering Holly was raised amongst in her upbringing in East Tennessee. “There’s a pervasive narrative of technology as dehumanizing,” says Holly. “We stand in contrast to that. It’s not like we want to run away; we’re very much running towards it, but on our terms. Choosing to work with an ensemble of humans is part of our protocol. I don’t want to live in a world in which humans are automated off stage. I want an AI to be raised to appreciate and interact with that beauty ” Just as ‘Platform’ forewarned of the manipulative personal and political impacts of prying social media platforms long before popular acceptance, ‘PROTO’ is a euphoric and principled statement setting the shape of things to come.\" less"

Sounds a lot like Werk Discs’ Grim Dubs series c. 2005. \"Recorded primarily with the DJ in mind, these tracks are colourful, brutalist and adventurous. Contemporary hybrids constructed from blocks of sound, their angular rhythms draw on Britain's dance music past, but with an eye firmly on the present. The album starts with 'St. Fabian Tower', named after the now demolished tower block in Chingford where Anthoney used to DJ for Rude FM. The track's lush detuned synths and syncopated drums are girded by stern low end frequencies. Drum and bass, jungle and hardcore are the touchstones here, but the forms he creates make no attempt to imitate the music of those eras. Take the rolling, bubbling, almost jazz-drummer patterns of 'Yeah, I Like It' and 'I Want You' where strange pops and bubbles seem to be forced through the grid almost like they're an effect of pressure. It's an odd juxtaposition next to the soulful vocals but an effective one. 'Edge Of Darkness' meanwhile, is an intense, rough ride of sliding rhythms and elephantine bass. Elsewhere, like on 'A New Consciousness', things are tempered into a more streamlined techno-like hybrid. He lets loose in the claps and kicks banger of 'Fi Di Gyal', but even here there are neat sonic tricks that sound like nods to minimalist composition. On The Threshold is a balance of smart and energetic, non linear thoughtfulness and makeshift experimentalism that does away with boundaries, but is very much its own self contained world.\" less"

Stevie Moore, Laetitia Sadier for their 5th LP of sugary songcraft ““Under Pressure” is Von Spar's fifth album, not counting their homage to Can (recorded live with Stephen Malkmus). 15 years have passed since their debut “Die uneingeschränkte Freiheit der privaten Initiative”, five since the “Streetlife” album. On closer examination, there is a somewhat chameleonesque quality to Von Spar’s discography. Their records are the result of continuous metamorphosis, opening wormholes to post punk, krautrock and 80s art pop. The constants: rhythmic refinement and harmonic quantum leaps, swirling synthesizer arpeggios, backwards guitars with no hint of retrogradation. The eight songs on “Under Pressure” were recorded in Von Spar’s Dumbo Studio in Cologne, with guests from Toronto, Tokyo, New York, London and Nashville adding noteworthy contributions. As on “Streetlife”, the formative voice belongs to Chris A. Cummings alias Marker Starling. His distinctive falsetto graces over half of the songs, asking: “Is there a cure for this / Unhappiness, happiness?” On the opening track, Cummings is joined by Eiko Ishibashi (Kafka's Ibiki, Jim O'Rourke, Merzbow) in a Japanese dream sequence exploring where they might get to if the shackles of the flesh are cast off.

From album-opener ‘THRRVL’, Tracey tracks the initially gentle undulations of his studio seemingly waking to life, plotting a neat melodic shuffle on ‘TRR’ and then, by, ‘CCLRT’, something dense, trippy and yearning. From hereon in, ‘Biostar’ plots an intriguing course through hypnotic, clockwork crunch (‘THWRD’), to Drexciyan submersion (‘HDRCSTCS’) and rhythmic experimentation on ‘PHTCPHRK’. Some of the more affecting moments on ‘Biostar’ emerge from it’s more obtuse sections; ‘DTFNK’ deciphers a surprisingly catchy melody among waves of scrambled signals, while the initially skittish ‘DRMRBT’ blossoms into an electro lullaby at 126bpm. By the arrival of wistful closing track ‘CLSTLBNG’, listeners are likely to emerge content from the deepest exploration yet of Tracey’s unique analogue ecosystem.” less"

Upon its release, ‘Prototypes’ marked a new high water mark of precision tooled electronic minimalism.

Apparently John Malkovich makes an appearance too... Comprising all new material recorded over the past 2 years, and made using similar technology and tekkers as his ‘80s classics, Leon’s sequel finds him riff deeper on the cosmic lore of Mali’s Dogon tribe of Mali, whose exhibition of art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1973 first inspired him to make ‘Nommos’; a visionary piece of NYC’s new wave/downtown puzzle released by John Fahey’s Takoma, which has re-emerged among the most crucial, revelatory reissues of this decade via everywhere from Volcanic Tongue to Superior Viaduct, and RVNG Intl’s deluxe ‘Anthology of Interplanetary Folk Music Vol.2’. The ‘Nommos’ Leon refers to are part of the Dogon tribe’s creation myth revolving visitations by an amphibious alien race from the white dwarf Sirius B who came to impart their wisdom on humankind. Resonating with then prevailing new age thought and conceptually pre-echoing Rashad Becker’s ‘Traditional Music For Notional Species’, the project sincerely speaks to electronic music’s ideals of transcendence, both (meta)physical and spiritual, beautifully employing the use of synthesis as a means of divination and hyperstition, ‘The Canon’ leads directly on from ‘Nommos’ and ‘Visitation’, tracing the alien knowledge/arithmetic/energy’s journey from Mali to Egypt and Greece in a narrative arc that unfolds like a map for inner exploration, coursing from the ceremonial chorale of ‘The Earliest Trace’ thru glyphic drum communications in ‘The Respondent in Dispute’, and the panoramic beauty of ‘Four Floods of the Point’, before opening the tantalising wormhole of ‘The Gates Made Plain’, and atomically diffusing into ether with ‘Departure’.

Lovers of quiet minimalism will be in their element with this suite, spanning nearly 50 years of recordings by two artist musicians whose influence has shaped generations after them, and continues to resonate throughout many forms of minimalist modern classical and the avant-garde. ““For Feldman, dynamics serve an acoustical function. When he mitigates a piano attack he reduces that spike of noise that’s at the onset of every piano sound leaving only the sinusoidal pure after-sound. It’s as if he invented electronic music with the piano.” Alvin Lucier from liner notes. “Lucier manages to hear a layer of acoustical physics in Feldman’s music that perhaps no one else would hear.

   "name": "Contemporary genius James Ferraro pushes his hybrid style to beautiful effect with a 62 minute opus striking an elegiac nerve of brilliantly slippery soundtrack music that short circuits the difference between Philip Glass’ music for ‘Koyaanisqatsi’, the kind of schlocky tones you might expect on a Graham Hancock video about ancient civilisations and some Hans Zimmer score for a wide-eyed Spielberg epic, as if re-imagined by 0PN and Kara-Lis Coverdale. The piece breaks down into 11 parts, conducting a spellbinding traverse from the primal, metallic noise and buoyant chorale of ‘Embryo’ to the bittersweet curdle of ’Xerces Blau’, taking in spectacular FM synthesis sound designs with the transitions between ‘Omega Generation’ and ‘Cyber Seed’ or the perceptive depth to ‘Recycled Sky that show off an enhanced grasp of production nous, all while still allowing for that Mona Lisa smirk to his sound with the title and EDM nods in ‘Malign Blossom’. As ever with Ferraro, though, not all is quite what it seems. He somehow manages to highlight an ambiguity between the objective reality and its mediated, subjective reflection, with a music that speaks to the impending, heightening drama of the situation, but also the saccharine melodrama of weepy emoji-adorned social media statuses (#Attenborough) and the well-meaning but ultimately piecemeal measures taken to avoid the inevitable. 😢 less"

Originally issued towards the start of the Vaporwave craze, in the wake of seminal early efforts by 0PN as KGB Man & Chuck Person, this album by Ramona Andra Xavier turned a playful idea into a formulaic and frankly pretty annoying style which has been riffed on by any kid with YouTube and a copy of audacity.

   "name": "Celebrated cellist Oliver Coates beautifully expands upon his blink ’n miss 2018 release of ‘John Luther Adams’ Canticles of the Sky’ with a further three takes on pieces from the same John Luther Adams release, plus an alternate version. Originally issued by RVNG Intl in early 2018 as a primer for their release of Coates’ ’Shelley’s On Zenn-la’ album, the RSD pressing of 1000 copies flew out, so it’s a mercy that he’s now returned to delve deeper into the same album, with results ranking among his most definitive solo recordings. In contrast to Coates’ other solo records, there’s no discernible electronics in the album, bar one obvious omission in the ‘(Alt FX Render)’ of ‘Above Sunset’. That one aside, the others effectively reveal what myriad other artists - from The Corrs to Radiohead, Actress and Mica Levi - have been privy to in the studio: simply Coates’ untreated cello in its naked form. Currently based in that Cairngorms, in the northern Scottish Highlands, it’s maybe easy to understand why John Luther Adams’ musical transcriptions of the Alaskan wilds appealed so much to Coates. In a way intended to mimic or emulate the music of an Aeolian Harp, he plays open strings that reflect the “untouched” nature of the Aolian Harp - a wind-blown instrument often found on hill tops or open spaces - and describe the sun’s slow, low arc as viewed from northerly latitudes. The four ’Sky’ pieces are each as sublime as the next, while the new parts - form the same original Adams album - feel equally natural, elemental, especially in the head-thizzing, elegant dynamics of ‘The Wind at Maclaren Summit.’ less"

For Belgium’s Ekster, he wraps up a super juicy collection showcasing his playfully frayed and over-microdosed style at its most colourful and dextrous, and all sealed for freshness by his own sleeve artwork. It’s a proper album in an old skool sense, toggling the tempos and vibes for a charmed narrative cadence, but there’s also a subtly virulent, unpredictable gremlin in the works that characterises his project’s surname and serves to place his sound in the flatlands of here and now, where late ‘80s FM styles modulate late ‘90s IDM into fractal mutant modernism. less"

Big RIYL: Photek, Caterina Barbieri, SND, Lee Gamble, Gábor Lázár... A hypnotic soundworld tempered by weighty bass and angular construction, ‘Vanity’ marks a breaking away from the binds of overthinking, an embrace of imperfection. It’s a brighter set of tracks then anything we’ve heard from them before, discarding the fog of filters and guitar pedals in pursuit of a more loose-limbed and swung ideal. Opening on the skeletal Trance vapour-trail ‘Sim Screen’ and the agitated ‘Repatterning’, we head into a ferociously asymmetric warehouse swerve ‘In Gold Mills’ conjuring an uncanny, nighttime vision of suburban bass riddled with tension and bliss. ‘Shallows’ retreats through isolation dub, echoing ‘Change Is Never Easy’, a re-worked House template fractured to its bare percussive core, while ‘FM2’ entwines a double helix of DX7 patches with a heart wrench, and ‘Gauze’ dismantles a mosaic of Kwaito patterns, buried under a haze of smoke. Tracing rapidly mutating electronic forms, from ringtone hooks to latinate rhythms and Razor synth edits, ‘Vanity’ explores an instinctive swell of ideas and influences in perpetual and unstoppable forward motion, a sequence of flash frames captured and distilled for posterity. less"

   "name": "This is a total find - ‘Tanz Und Andacht’ (Dance and Devotion) is a mouth-wateringly rare and otherworldly missive from Hamburg’s cult, highly enigmatic label/band Werkbund, a bizarre, crazily ahead-of-its time project that finds the sweet spot between Coil and Torsten Pröfrock's work as Dynamo / Various Artists, now reissued on vinyl with two bonus tracks to the pleasure of weirdos across the world, more than 20 years after the long sold-out original 2x7” release. Since 1987, Werkbund have remained a riddle to practically anyone outside their studio. Between the late ‘80s and the ‘00s, they released a handful of LPs and CDs on the enigmatic Walter Ulbricbht Schallfolien and the related Abraum label, including some extraordinary electronic recordings by Mechthildt Von Leusch, a properly shady character, who, if Google is translating correctly, would also appear to be behind this 1997 album, ranging from beautifully windswept synths and airborne waltzes to deeply creepy horror themes. We won’t front - Werkbund and their related projects are relatively new to us, but we could tell from only a few bars of this LP, which somehow fathoms everything from widescreen ambient to proto-T++ style metallic dubs, that they’re a seriously special project, and the kind of stuff we dream about discovering every day. And in the strangest way, to our ears their music feels uncannily familiar, like the illusion of Déjà entendu, yet somehow utterly fresh and unique at the same time. ‘Tanz Und Andacht’ very much plays into its own schism with one side full of inquisitive and rhythmic electronics, and the other dank and cranky as your life. Spine-chills cascade from the front in ‘Lichtregen’ triggering a surreal, warped side that bends between the sort of slow, minimal but generous polyrhythms favoured in Vladimir Ivkovic DJ sets, and pockets of genuine mystery such as the head-licking ‘Allseele’, which is perhaps best compared with the best of Leyland Kirby’s ‘Intrigue & Stuff’ volumes. The flipside however is much starker, traversing the vinegary, vintage Lynchian tone of ‘Perl Weiss’ and ice palace harmonics of ‘Im Heiligen Hain’ alongside the carmine seep and trailing fade-outs of ‘Eine Von Diesen’ and the chthonic breaths of bonus piece ‘Die Abendburg.’ Fair to say that with original copies now going for the prices of a week’s rent in Manchester, there’s probably a lot of industrial/ambient fiends gleefully rubbing their hands over a pot of beans right. less"

   "name": "My Disco finally unveil their debut album for Downwards, a brilliant rendering of concrète/industrial styles recorded in the same Berlin studio often frequented by Einstürzende Neubauten, Pan Sonic and Keiji Haino, somehow channelling the spirit of all three. It’s an intensely rich and wildly unexpected trip that takes in the ragged intensity of Suicide alongside gong recordings and a kind of isolationist ambient spirit that resides somewhere between Selected Ambient Works Vol II and Raime. ‘Environment’ finds My Disco in the midst of deep synth despair, leaving behind the gnashing guitars in favour of cold metallic percussion and gloomy pads reverberating in derelict, factory-like space. Gutting out the driving, mathy repetition of their prized early work (2010’s Steve Albini-produced ’Young/You’ is a favourite of Karl O’Connor/Regis), the Melbourne-based trio now recall the ungodly offspring of Raime and Swans, operating with an increased appreciation of space, rhythm and tone that will shock even the hardest to please explorers of avant-rock and industrial fault lines. In no uncertain terms its 8 tracks plumb the depths of a foul mood, strafing thru a series of antechamber-like stations like some inelegant beast encumbered with clanking manacles and ankle restraints. Thanks to the visceral, vivid nature of the recording and production, the devil lies in the synaesthetic sonic/visual detail, riddling a mostly wordless narrative that perfectly says it without saying it. Biting down first with the jagged metallic klang and gnawing drones of ‘An Intimate Conflict’, the album continues to fetishise both bleeding-raw and cinematic themes thru the torture chamber ambience of ‘Exercise In Sacrifice’, and the red-lining tone poem ‘Act’, leading into belly of the beast bass growls on ‘Rival Colour’, before the dissonant, keening might of ‘No Permanence’ calves off into a closer to end all closers, with the band’s Cornell Wilczek feeding Buchla Easel tones into the empty tank strikes and fetid atmosphere of ‘Forever’ with a febrile effect worthy of Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement. By any measure, ‘Environment’ is one of Downwards’ most singular albums, and a must-check for disciples of proper, unheimlich sonics. Trust it’ll wipe that art school smirk right off your mug. less"

The album kicks off with ‘The Trip’, in which Murray invites you to “pack your bags / hit the open road”, and she could be describing the band’s own creative trajectory: this a far airier, more widescreen LP than its predecessor, with a clarity to the production and songwriting that surely will surely lead to daytime radio play and festival ubiquity (if it hasn’t already...we’re not the people to ask). We don’t say all this to denigrate Still Corners: you have to take your hat off to such finely crafted AOR missiles as ‘Beginning To Blue’, a bruised, synth-daubed ballad easily the equal of Feist in full flight, and very much in her patented mature, melancholic, electro-organic style. The guitar parts are lovely, variously invoking The Police’s slick minimalism, Twin Peaks roadhouse twang and Paisley Underground jangle, and Murray’s voice is pleasingly gossamer-thin without being substanceless; she has the versatility and gusto to handle gnomic, near-abstract miniatures (‘Beatcity’) and forays into full-on, bouffant synth-pop (‘Fireflies’) alike.

Played with unreal timing and precision, Kukangandei’s pointillist chops and stop/start rhythms aren’t just mathematically sound as fuck, they’re also riddled with curious melodic sensibility and funk that generally escapes math rock types, effectively making a lot of other stuff seem sloppy, boring and ancient by comparison. Ideologic Organ boss and Sunn 0))) legend Stephen O’Malley tells us why he signed them for this release: “Kukangendai is a kick ass rock trio from Kyoto (Tokyo transplants). When I first hear this band live I was instantly transfixed by their minimalist yet illusory primitive, polyrythmic and structural, memory evoking rock narratives. Their energy is completely and transparently palpable yet handled with restraint of the pleasure of a disciplined form dealing with time and articulation. They are a power trio of bass, drums and guitar but the music they play is as much the limbic system of a forest than it is a geode. They started in 2006. They left Tokyo to Kyoto and started the cult venue Soto (“Outside”) “to listen to music they hadn’t heard yet” a few years later. They collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto last year. They reminded me of James Brown on a heavy binge of Bastro, there’s a deep current of both archaic musical tastes and the human desire for articulating that archaism in there, but you shake your ass and get the shouting in… in a punk basement … 13th century version of Breadwinner, the bare soul version.

   "name": "First vinyl reissue since 1987 - contains two bonus tracks never before released on vinyl... \"Tidal Waves Music now proudly presents: the official reissue of this fantastic album, back available on vinyl for the first time since 1987. Available as a deluxe 180g 2XLP set, with TWO bonus tracks from the same session that were not featured on the original vinyl release. This album is limited to 500 copies worldwide and comes with an obi strip + liner notes by American jazz critic & author Kevin Whitehead. Pharoah ‘Farrell’ Sanders (born 1940) is a leading figure in the world of jazz and one of the last living legends with connections to players like Sun Ra and John Coltrane. His tenor saxophone playing has earned him royal status amongst free jazz players, critics and collectors. Originally Sanders was interested in urban blues music, but his high school teacher exposed him to jazz and this took Farrell in an entirely new direction. Once completing high school Sanders quickly packed his belongings and headed to Oakland, where he got a chance to work with musicians of high caliber such as saxophone players Sonny Simmons and Dewey Redman (who were both later to be major forces in new jazz and free jazz). Soon the young Pharoah would meet John Coltrane and would feel being attracted to the life as a professional musician. By the early sixties Sanders moved to New York where the major jazz scene was happening. Here he’d spent most his time honing his skills at rehearsals with Sun Ra….sadly he was not making much money with the Arkestra and soon found himself living on the streets, trying to stay up all night playing and then scrounging for money during the day, often selling blood to eat. Sanders recorded his debut album for ESP soon after, but it wasn't until he started playing with his old friend John Coltrane that he would fully unleash the fury of his saxophone on the world of free jazz. The records Pharoah Sanders played on for Coltrane laid the foundation of what was to come for both the world of free jazz and for Sanders as a musician. After Coltrane's tragic death Sanders would record further with Alice Coltrane, John's widow, on the album Karma (1969 - Impulse!), which is universally accepted as Sanders' masterpiece. Along with musicians Alice Coltrane and singer Leon Thomas, Sanders helped to create the genre of spiritual jazz. On the album we are presenting you today (Africa from 1987) Sanders plays with an all-star line-up consisting of Idris Muhammad, John Hicks and Curtis Lundy. Muhammad brings his trademark tight sense of timekeeping, but with a looseness that we love – and Lundy’s warm soulful bass does more than enough to give the set a sound bottom- all this while Hick’s free lyrical piano works nicely with Sander’s spiritual horn. The brilliant ‘Africa sessions’ features the quartet at their best...soulful but also searching for a strong groove at the same time. The music here is less ornamented than on most of Sanders’ studio recordings, where sextets, septets or larger lineups have been the norm, but this brilliant effort here remains every bit as compelling. Pharoah and his crew play with the utmost sensitivity and give a demonstration that shows us the full extent of their skills.\" less"

   "name": "Not Glass is the hugely immersive, often surprising debut collaboration between Alessio Natalizia (Not Waving) and his longtime correspondent Dimitris Papadatos (Jay Glass Dubs), deploying a sublime and unexpected line of mystic, ambient dub and tribal rhythms to reconfigure what we know about their respective outputs. If you regularly join dots between Eno & Budd, Sylvian & Sakamoto, Peter Gabriel & John Carpenter, and crave that sweet spot where pop and ambient archetypes reach an unsteady equilibrium, this one’s spectacularly satisfying. Paying tribute to Latin and Greek authors Ovid and Heraclitus in a suite of sublime electronics and cryptic rhythms comparable to a theatrical soundtrack, ‘Forma’ is the result of years of daily chats between the London and Athens-based artists where they cemented the album’s concept around key quotes by the legendary poet/philosophers, who hail from their respective homelands of Italy and Greece. On this timeless plane, Natalizia and Papadatos spaciously consolidate their contrasting, rhythm-driven approaches in a reverberant, often beatless sphere of exploration. Removed from their usual handrails, the artists operate at their most open-ended and suggestive, amorphously shapeshifting from gloaming shadowplays of synth and keys to investigate arcane percussive impulses and iridescent ambient whorls. The result is a perfect, finely shaded marriage of their mutually esoteric, outsider Southern European energies, which intuitively acknowledges and inhabits the paradoxes of their respective styles. The illusively static yet mercurial ebb and flow of the atmospheric intro ‘Fallite fallentes’ sets the scene, where ‘Dum loquor, hora fugit’ invokes a viscous but brittle tangle of wide bass and pointillist rhythms beside a stately cello vignette ‘Ludicrum’ that recalls aspects of Scott Walker’s mystic charm ’Soused’. The rapid arps and slow moving, glassy pads of ‘Pauper ubique iacet’ conjure a sublime tension that becomes diffused into the cavernous, hollow dub dread of ‘Ut ameris, amabilis esto’, possessed with its throaty, processed vocal, and the lonely strings and plasmic electronics of ‘Forma bonum fragile est’ connotes a psychedelic coming-to-terms with their artistic/philosophic duality. Total pearl this one. less"

Following a long trip to Japan, McBride became \"addicted\" to vintage synths, and returned to his studio in Derbyshire to write the album. The twelve-track long player still contains his trademark rural soundscapes suspended in a rich seam of hooks and emotive synth arrangements but this time with focus on more weightless, looming melodies that extend throughout the album. ‘Images' distils the pure essence of the Synkro sound, a step in a different direction from some of his more beat led releases and an alternative from his collaborations with Liam Blackburn (as Akkord) or more recently with Arovane. Yet the music is still immediately recognisable and it’s an album in the old fashioned sense that is best consumed whole.” less"

RIYL David Behrman, M Geddes Gengras, Matt Carlson “Nearly all of my recorded music is pieced together from organized edits of various improvisations of some sort, via a composition process that generally involves cut/paste and superimposing those to a point of precision. Over time I’ve been curious about what gets lost in that process, in terms of representing how things develop over time and spontaneity. In 2016, I found myself with a 20-minute improvisation that felt distinguished in it's raw form, mistakes and all. It felt like a more guttural, gritty approach that represents how I actually “play” as an instrumentalist, which is something I’ve consciously downplayed in previous work out of preference for spatial and environmental elements. I sat on the piece for a while, then a year and a half later, when a second improvisation materialized that felt familial to the first, it seemed that a work had completed itself. Voice Damage is a bit of an exposure of the exploratory aspects of my process, where I’m not really thinking in terms of music composition or preconception, just playing in the moment as an instrumentalist.” less"

Recorded live sometime in January 1978, the album is really most distinguished by Ra’s inimitable use of the Crumar Mainman keyboard, which was then - and still is - a rare model of “string synthesiser” that was only manufactured between the 60s and ’84. It captivatingly lights up the whole LP, from the super dark and grungy blasts that open with ‘Saturn Research’ thru its application as bubbling groove box underlining Ra’s hieroglyphic riffs and Michael Ray’s sharp trumpet in ‘Constellation’, to the wigged out blatz in ‘Year of the Sun’, before spiralling out into gobsmacking double helixes of synth and trumpet and collapsing into alien squabble on the title tune.

   "name": "Shelter Press’ remarkable run of 2017 releases ends in deep contemplation with this beautiful exploration of traditional Northern Indian classical music recorded with an experimental emphasis, carrying out the aural equivalent of zooms and close-ups, weaving between the minute details of sound and the more expansive effect on the listener. Recorded by artist Darren Almond, each of the pieces here corresponds to imagery from his eponymous video installation, shot in Rajasthan, 2012. Revolving around recordings of Fateh Ali (Santoor, Manjira), Ghulam Gouse (Tabla), Roop Singh (Manjira), and Zakir Hussain (Bansari), All Things Pass seeks to connect the ancient Indian artform of the raga, whose time-based structures link the movement of the stars to earthly events, with the individual player’s emotions. In this complex feedback loop of cosmic information and terrestrial expression, Almond operates as a sensory relay or transducer, using a shotgun microphone to document the instruments and synaesthetically offering a sort of sensory lens that regulates the liminal link between the macrocosmic, or universal, and the molecular, more human level of existence. From its meter-melting Tabla drum pulses, to the refractive metallic shimmer of dulcimer-like Santoor and the Maniira hand cymbals, threaded with airborne stripes of flute-like Bansuri, the naturally fluid but closely disciplined results can be heard as a prism for realigning our Western-based and shaped perceptions of time. It’s really only when you fully comprehend how closely these things are linked in Indian classical culture that you may realise how restrictive and naive so much Western instrumental music, with its minor and major modes, and reliance on fixed time signatures, can be. By that token, it’s not difficult to hear why the plasmic, meter and scale-dissolving possibilities of electronic music - when applied inventively - appeal to listeners who’ve become bored with the arrogance of Western convention. Effectively, All Things Pass ties all these ideas in a way that is self-evident, requiring the listener to simply allow themselves to interpret its expressive mathematics in their own way, and real unto themselves maths as the universal language. It offers a soothing, thought provoking end to a tumultuous year, and marks Shelter Press as one of the most rewarding and diverse labels on the contemporary scene. less"

   "name": "In which the erstwhile Yellow Swan expands upon the structures of 'Movement Building' with a 2nd volume of cavernous drone and drum space to follow Stephen O'Malley's 'Éternelle Idole' on Felicia Atkinson and Bartolemé Sanson's Shelter Press. \"An early inspiration for both The Sensationalists and the music collected in Movement Building Vol. 2 was the novel Snow Country by Yasunari Kawabata. The classic Japanese novel from 1956 tells the story of a geisha in a small mountain town and her married and wealthy male lover (a self-taught musician and self-appointed expert of Western ballet, respectively). Their tragic love affair, set amidst the snow, hot springs and mountains, became a thematic and contextual source for early phases of the project, and much of the music on this album is a result. Borrowing compositionally and tonally from Taiko and Gagaku (an ancient drone based imperial court music), Saloman reproduced sounds originating in traditional Japanese drums, wind and stringed instruments almost completely on guitar, ride cymbals and snare drum. This influence is most explicit in the undulating rhythms that open the first side of Vol. 2 (Contained Battle/Ascend) and the layered escalation of the literally titled Gagaku, a methodical combination of rhythm and drone that climbs to a peak of psych-tinged burning guitar lines. Between these tracks are situated Ear Piercer and Mountain Music, two songs that have been staples of Saloman’s viscerally intense live sets for the last two years. Concluding the album is a version of Miles’ Davis’ classic ballad, My Funny Valentine. This epilogue of sorts is a uncanny combination of original percussion and guitar, collaged together with what may be a live recording of Davis’ “second great quintet” taken off of YouTube, processed and time-stretched on tape. Conceived of as support for a duet interpreting a shambolic, drunken encounter between Snow Country’s protagonists, the piece provides a cool denouement following the drawn out intensities of what preceded it.\" less"

   "name": "Official reissue of cult maxi single Eisbär by Swiss band Grauzone with cult 45rpm-or-33prm-ready b-side \"FILM 2\" - for fans of electronic, new wave, cold wave, Swiss wave, Neue Deutsche Welle (Welle means wave!), synth, pop, post-punk, proto-techno, 80s, Stephan Eicher, Marco Repetto, Liaisons Dangereuses, Tristesse Contemporaine, Young Marble Giants, Swizerland, mountains, polar bears, and xerox machines. \"Ich möchte ein Eisbär sein…Written by Martin Eicher after a nightmare in which he saw talking polar bears on the walls, and with music by the Grauzone crew consisting of Martin and his brother Stephan Eicher, Marco Repetto, Christian \"GT\" Trüssel, and Claudine Chirac (on saxophone), \"Eisbär\" is the most recognizable title from the band, a sublime mix of ingredients reflecting the transitional era it comes from - the raw energy of punk music still palpable, combined with the audacity of early electronics, the warm groove of a disco gem, beautifully fragile lyrics, and one of the best basslines ever. It became a mega hit, totally unplanned, but how could you resist such a track? \"FILM 2\" is the ultimate b-side monster, a menacing all-instrumental pre-techno masterpiece, slowly building to a magnetizing frenzy. An instant underground favorite, it was famously heard played at both speeds depending on the scenes and DJs you were frequenting, 45rpm as it was first intended, and 33rpm for the cosmic experience (search Daniele Baldelli’s Cosmic C75 1982 mixtape online for a great example of this). The maxi single ends with \"Ich Lieb Sie\", a synth-pop meets doo-wop ballad, a true love song oozing with innocence. Simple, stylish, and just right. At the crossroads of post-punk, new wave, pop, and electronic experimentation, the Eisbär maxi offers three songs that are technically different but hold the same spirit, the perfect embodiment of Grauzone’s music - wild, unpredictable, and youthful, yet sophisticated, catchy, and ingenious. The magic recipe for the good stuff. Stephan Eicher went on to be, arguably, the most successful Swiss musician ever, with an international career extending from pop chanson to experimental escapades and collaborations with Moondog, artists Sophie Calle and John Armleder, and author Martin Suter among many other luminaries. Marco Repetto flourished as a techno and ambient producer, releasing multiple projects including releases on Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label.\" less"

   "name": "The wonderfully disorienting ’What A Mess’ is the first album in 21 years from deep and psychedelic house maestro Pépé Bradock There will be a lot of house heads who won’t even read past that first line and already be clicking buy right now, but for everyone else you need to know this is some of the freakiest, freeform house music you’ll hear this decade. Constructed as a seamless work split in two over one LP, Bradock leaves all the details such as track titles and background info purposefully open ended and possibly apocryphal, to reflect the music’s serendipitous construction and psychedelic-realist feel and leave it open to interpretation. The result is a mind-bending flux of styles that sounds like he recorded in the GRM studios, traversing chaotic swells of acephalic voices, super dank ethers, concrète shrapnel, spiralling disco licks and pockets of hyper electro-dub in its alternately brittle, lucid, and viscous, gauzy flow. It’s not really a DJ record, unless you’re prepared with sticky tape markers denoting the parts where the groove resolves. It’s much better received in altered states, after the club, when logic is frayed and you’re almost bound to have to remind yourself 10 times “what the fuck is this record, again?” Tip! less"

Weighing in at 28 trax wide and 292 minutes long, ‘GRM Trax’ is arguably the motherload of all EVOL releases. It features the OG deco-rave duo applying their unrelenting, uncompromising process to a classic vintage synth with transfixing results ready to open a vast, pulsating wormhole in your living room or wherever it is that freaks like to consume their EVOL (betcha someone does it in the bog). Pushing the classic early ‘70s synth in a way not previously heard, EVOL make only the slightest envelope shifts in each part, allowing the machine to gurn and chatter in its purest, buzzing vernacular. With such unyielding focus on each tweak, they encourage a total immersion in the sounds’ pure signal and its resonant overtones. We can confirm the effect is extremely uncanny and totally disorientating after headphone ingestion, meaning that once the cans came off every sound in the room will still pulse freakishly. For the sake of your sanity and the health of your ears, it’s maybe not best to do the whole release in one go - or at least not loudly on headphones - but for those who love to peer into the abyss, we can assure you of a heavily sensational, mind-bending experience quite unlike any other. less"

   "name": "The Lioness is the first Jason Molina project to fully turn away from the battlefield folk and deconstructed Americana of earlier Songs: Ohia recordings. At the dawn of the 21st century, the album felt modern. It aligned Molina with a new set of peers — Low, Gastr del Sol, Red House Painters and, most importantly, the influential Scottish band Arab Strap, whose producer and members were crucial in the creation of The Lioness. \"The avant- garde tones and arrangements of Arab Strap are absorbed here into Molina’s songwriting to create what would become, for many acolytes, the archetypal Songs: Ohia sound. Love & Work: The Lioness Sessions, the box set reissue, will serve as the seminal log of the era, complete with lost songs, photos, drawings, and essays from those who knew Molina best. We know Molina was diligent in both love and work. He treated songcraft like a job at the mill, and his approach to romance was not so different. We know that when he fell in love with his wife, he was dutiful in his adoration. There were strings of love letters and poetic gesture. Included in this edition are replicated examples of this relentless love — an envelope with a letter from Molina, a photograph of Molina and his to-be wife, a postcard, a Two of Hearts playing card, and a personal check for one million kisses. Some of these items were gifts he would send to his new love from the road; others, like the 2 of Hearts, were totems he’d carry with him around this time as a symbol for his burgeoning love. And so, the head-over-heels album that is The Lioness has its workman counterpart. Nearly another album’s worth of material was recorded in Scotland during the album sessions. While similar in tone and structure, the songs seem to deal in the grit and dirt of being. These are songs for aching muscles getting soothed in the third-shift pub. But they’re also examples of Molina’s diligence as he constructs what would be the essential elements of The Lioness. In addition to these outtakes, we also have a 4-track session made weeks earlier in London with friend James Tugwell. Comprised of primarily guitar, hand drums and voice, these songs are raw experiments that mostly serve to illustrate Molina’s well of words and ideas. But then, there is the devastating Sacred Harp hymn “Wondrous Love.” While he may have had his new love in mind, one can’t help but think of Molina’s legacy as he softly warbles “Into eternity I will sing/Into eternity I will sing.” You don’t have to try too hard to mythologize Molina. He did all the work for you.\" less"

   "name": "Félicia Atkinson is a multidisciplinary artist with many strings to her bow. Hand In Hand elevates her work to a completely higher plain as far as we are concerned though; fusing field recordings, modular and MIDI electronics with an almost hypnotising line in whispered/ASMR vocal narration to subliminally affective degrees, lulling us into an alien - yet incredibly human - soundsphere. It’s rare to hear a singular artistic vision translated into a sound that is so inherently personal and inviting - but somehow Hand In Hand is both one of the most accessible, and most experimental albums we encountered in 2017. It’s riddled with so much nuance that many months on we’re still discovering hidden new crevices with every listen. If you’ve yet to hear it - what are you waiting for? Preeminent avant-garde composer Felicia Atkinson weaves myriad, filigree electro-acoustic and non-musical metanarratives in her totally absorbing follow-up to A Readymade Ceremony [2015] - a remarkable album which attracted high acclaim worldwide and pushed her to the core of the modern experimental sphere. Hand In Hand consolidates Atkinson's refined palette of modular and MIDI electronics with ASMR voices, field recordings and instrumental improvisation to subliminally affective degrees, whilst conveying the ambitious complexities of her sound art with a harmoniously organic, spaciously poised appeal. Where her last album A Readymade Ceremony emerged fully formed from a protracted period of experimentation and research whilst based in The Alps c. 2013-2015, Hand In Hand finds Félicia building a metaphysical playground on its foundations, meshing recordings and lyrics - found and composed between her home in Brittany and Stockholm’s EMS facilities - into a finely sculpted and dreamlike web of subtle sensations and hyperstisised fiction. In the process she brings closer together a wide-range of her artistic practices, incorporating elements of sculpture and painting along with sound installation, multichannel diffusion and live performance into her ever-expanding sonic vocabulary and grammar. Whether consumed on headphones or loudspeakers, it’s clear to hear this sharply honed sound sensitivity come into play as her carefully hushed vocals are bathed in placid yet suspenseful tones and almost imperceptibly underlined by an attention to timbral detail and those infrasonic frequencies normally ignored or blithely unattended by other composers within the field. This all becomes apparent within the first side’s transition from warbling ambient-pop/neo-classical in I’m Following You to a stark contrast of hushed ASMR vocals and Rashad Becker-ish crack-bug electronics in Valis laid over Oren Ambarchi-esque bass tones, and then again into the hyaline gamelan dimensions of Curious In Epidavros, each laced with layers of spectral detail that only reveal themselves after multiple listens, and quite differently in each mode (headphones or speakers). The dichotomies or paradoxes between the seen/heard/felt and unseen/unheard/elusive continue to beautifully, mystically inform and frame the rest of the album; begging us to chase her vocals around the stereo field of and mazy shimmers of Adaptation Assez Facile into the upside down oddness of Monstera Deliciosa’s rising basses and the curiously erotic lyrics about plants in Visage, before calving off into squashed rhythms with the hymn, A House A Dance A Poem, emerging into the sublime, weightless ambience of Hier Le Désert, and the surreal avian jazz Buchla strokes that resolve No Fear But Anticipation. In the best way this is a record that is immediate and enduring; transparent yet oblique, riddled with nuance and underlying layers that keener listeners will discover in their own time. less"

   "name": "Sweden’s Johanna Knutsson steps away from Berlin techno and into a pastoral sublime with the natural, utopian scenes of her debut solo album “Tollarp Transmissions is a deeply personal and moving album created by Johanna Knutsson. Closing herself off from the flutter of the outside world in her Berlin studio, Johanna has painted a series of melancholic yet warm pictures of her childhood for Kontra-Musik. Johanna grew up in the small hamlet of Tollarp in the south of Sweden, surrounded by fields, forests and silence – a priced commodity not to be found in Berlin. Each track is named after a physical memory of Tollarp, the intro Vramsån, for instance, is named after a stream close to Johanna’s home and heart. Befittingly, the first timbres of Vramsån remind one of Tuba Mirum from Mozart’s Requiem, solemnly played by an old ice cream truck. A sound every child in Sweden knows. Tollarp Transmissions is not a grand Requiem, however. It’s a heartbreaking Reminiscence. A crisp winter night blasted with stars. A child’s neck bent upwards in amazement, creaking snow beneath her feet. The stars singing to her in voices no-one else can hear. Change of scene. A summer’s day is slowly dying. The low humming of sated insects. Bursts of muffled laughter from a nearby porch. The shadowy forest marching slowly on the neatly trimmed lawns. The difference between hiding and getting lost is obscured by the silent trees. Change of scene. A mighty storm ravaging the barren forest and the sleeping fields. A branch crashing rhythmically against the windowsill of the blacked out kitchen. The grownups are tense, the child secretly enamoured with the wind. Change of scene. The stars are silenced by the lights of the city. She must sing to them now.” less"

   "name": "Berlin’s dark techno stalwart, Kareem commits a gloomily satisfying 2nd album of gothic drone and depth charge percussion with ‘Garden Of Time’, leading on from 2013’s ‘Porto Ronco’ LP for The Death of Rave First performed at Sam Kerridge’s Contort #15 in Berlin, 2015, and recently rearranged and extended for this release, ‘The Garden of Time’ presents a stealthy evolution of Kareem’s first longform attempt at this style, back with 2015’s ‘Porto Ronco’. Where that release absorbed listeners in its stark linearity, this new album is more layered and given to shifting, weathered moods, avoiding formalism through a broader palette of references to sub genres ranging from dark ambient to computer music and rhythmic noise. These are essentially the sounds Kareem dreams about in between making some of the finest dark techno known to humankind. ‘Inhale’ unmistakably reflects a nocturnal Berlin environment, but soberly so, as though perched beyond the gurning milieu in the city’s freezing dry cold, absorbing its sferic spirits and multi kulti makeup in shocks of processed outernational instrumentation and dissonant noise alarms. ‘The garden of Time’ follows more aggressively with eruption of broken toothed rhythm kicking off a stygian trudge into sombre, dank ambient and flashes of olde Berlin cabaret. less"

   "name": "Mouse On Mars’ Jan St. Werner in typically playful but studious form, presenting an LP version of his radio installation commissioned by the dokumenta 14 event in Athens “Jan St. Werner is a critically acclaimed and internationally recognized sound innovator. In a myriad of ways – as a solo artist, a collaborator, through his group Mouse On Mars, as a producer, as a lecturer at MIT, or as a professor of Dynamic Acoustic Research at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremburg - Werner has challenged traditional approaches to creating and experiencing music. The sixth installment of his Fiepblatter Catalogue series, Glottal Wolpertinger, endeavors to transcribe the phenomenon of sound as anarchic and highly sensitive material. His multilayered presentation of the project highlights the ways in which sound and music can fluctuate and re-constitute depending on context all within one consistent work. In keeping with the series’ collaborative nature, the pieces include contributions from guitarists Aaron & Bryce Dessner of The National, who Werner also collaborated with on Mouse On Mars’ Dimensional People, and The National’s Sleep Well Beast and I Am Easy To Find. Glottal Wolpertinger was initially conceived as a radio installation for documenta 14, the world's most renowned event for contemporary arts, with each of the tracks broadcasting individually over the course of ten weeks and culminating in a convergence of all eight tracks at a performance in Athens. The pieces consist of microtonally tuned feedback, multispectral drones which Werner modulated and filtered with a purposeful, and indeed vocalized, emphasis given to the different frequencies and textures used. By naming the individual frequency bands, Werner defies traditional tuning systems and instead centers the piece on collaging variable elements. Sonic elements churn and sprawl across the tracks in constant motion. Their drones, combatting for space, entangle one another and oscillate into overtones that shift, build, and wither with fluid motion that blurs the line between consonance and dissonance. Glottal Wolpertinger’s incarnation as a recording is no less potent than its preceding forms, but serves as a continuation of the project’s evolution as a distinct listening experience. Werner’s apt title for the project embellishes the ambiguity and cognitive dissonance inherent with the work, as the wolpertinger is a creature of European myth which is said to be the mutated result of different species breeding under special circumstances in the Alps. Glottal intonations are those produced by the guttural and throat region of the body, the center of organic sound. According to Werner, the wolpertingers are “bastards, collaged freaks who exist in the grey zone of nature’s perfect plan,” the same grey zone in which his pieces live.” less"

For fans of Carter, his CTI and Chris & Cosey duo with Cosey Fanni Tutti, or indeed his crucial role in Throbbing Gristle, these ‘Archival Recordings 1973-1977’ scan the relatively serene roots of what would become Industrial Music, and a seismic shift in underground experimental musicks. Predating both his work in COUM Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle, and his zinging debt LP ‘The Spaces Between’, the ‘Archival Recordings’ disc is perhaps of greatest interest, historically and artistically to long term fans of Carter’s musick. Spanning 1973-77, it covers the years just before, and after, Throbbing Gristle’s conception, when Carter was clearly in thrall to kosmische and psychedelia, but not beholden to them. Across 13 parts, Carter’s take on space music and pulsing early electronics is definitely less whimsical, much darker than other music of that period, progressing chronologically over the LP to reveal a full embrace of electronic music’s dark allure by the time we get to the hellish miasma of ‘See Sick’ [1977]. less"

But you’d hardly tell from the preternatural elegance and intimacy of their performance on ‘The Departing of a Dream Vol. VII’, where they jointly push off into scene of vanishing music, with choral-like sheets of barely discernible electric guitar melting into decaying trumpet drones and smoky air. Recorded in the reverberant environs of Murmrr Theatre, Brooklyn, in September 2017, and exquisitely mixed by Jim O’Rourke at Steamroll in Tokyo, the album reaches seamlessly across both sides in a billowing style that resonates with, for example, the spectral styles of Alex Zhang Hungtai’s ‘Divine Weight’. However, Carter and Connors’ efforts unfold with a guile and patient wisdom that speaks to more than a century of respective, lived experience, between them. Theirs is a timeless, abstract dialogue of incredible emotive subtlety and shading, operating at a languorous pace and with a crucial, subliminal grasp of amplitude control that it’s hard not to quickly fall under their spell, shut your eyes and be carried off behind your eyelids. No doubt this album is going straight onto the late night specials shelf. It’s just immaculate. less"

   "name": "Ex-Veronica Falls singer/songwriter Roxanne Clifford becomes Patience to express her synth pop tastes to the fullest on ‘Dizzy Spells’; an achingly well-crafted batch indebted as much to Todd Edwards - who co-produced the opening cut! - as New Order, AC Marias, Vince Clarke or Strawberry Switchblade “Dizzy Spells delivers a debut album that twists Clifford’s songwriting into new shapes and ecstasies. The album dances around melancholy, thrown to the floor like a bad dream to be circled, emerging bright-eyed into the early morning full of hope. The Girls Are Chewing Gum (produced by Todd Edwards) bursts open Dizzy Spells like fresh fruit: sweet and rich with a synth-bass line beamed down from Chicago House heaven. Exquisitely sung by Clifford, it’s a wonderful, funky, instant-classic hinting at sexuality and memories dredged from our bodies’ secrets. The bouncy production expertly renders the addictive power of our ephemeral pleasures. Living Things Don’t Last chases themes of longing and loss, opening up into a life affirming chorus that sings of transience, the passing of time and railing against inertia. It’s the perfect example of a song formula that Roxanne Clifford has almost patented: simple and cutting straight to the point. There are shades of Strawberry Switchblade or French synth pop pioneer Jacno in the happy/sad dichotomy and it is all the better for it. Dizzy Spells features all three long-sold out singles, embedded in the full depth of Patience’s soundworld they fit like pieces of a puzzle. White Of An Eye, The Church and The Pressure—all recorded in Clifford’s former home of Glasgow—crackle with razor sharp melodies and dancefloor-ready dynamics. There are exciting additions to Patience’s sonic palette, brought into sharp relief on Voices In The Sand. In this song, a plaintive Clifford enunciates a heart-torn plea to the antagonist, a mournful cascade of synths and haunting vocals evocative of AC Marias, a sepia-toned ode to anxiety, “a storm is on the way”. On No Roses, a Vince Clarkesque production belies a sunburnt sadness. Clifford defiantly sings “you would go out tonight, but there’s nowhere you like,” describing a disenchantment with her adopted city of Los Angeles, she longs for home in a singular refrain “No roses… no roses for us.” An ode to English folk singer Shirley Collins, a surprising yet innate influence throughout Clifford’s work. On Moral Damage, former Veronica Falls bandmate Marion Herbain joins Clifford on an anglo-french duet that feels instant and spontaneous, a cutting comment on emotional accountability. More than a vehicle for Roxanne Clifford’s songwriting prowess, Patience is holding our hand through the night, dancing with tears in our eyes, dizzy and spellbound.” less"

   "name": "Immaculate cold wave dance pop from Xavier Paradis’ Automelodi, one of Montreal’s finest and most influential, returning nearly a decade since their eponymous modern classic with a sterling effort for HoloDeck (Marie Davidson, S U R V I V E) Melding high gloss sound design with eloquent French vocals and an unmistakeable sense of romance, ‘Mirages au futur verre-brisé’ beautifully grasps the ghostly rose of ‘80s synth-pop and electronic dance music at its sleekest and most poignant, with results admirably comparable to classics from New Order, YMO, Hard Corps, Movement. Factor in a fine seam of experimental-leaning sonics and you have a truly flawless diamond that glitters from every angle. “Paradis was born and raised in Québec, gravitating towards the sounds of post-punk and industrial music in early adolescence. Inspired by the expanding tonal language of electronic instruments, Paradis fully immersed himself in the vocabulary of drum machines, samplers and synthesizers as his primary tools of composition. By the age of fifteen, Paradis was writing pop songs and dark ballads while developing his vocal style and learning to produce his own tracks. In the mid-’90s, Paradis truly formed his musical identity under the solo moniker Arnaud Lazlaud, recording and playing live for many years in the dense music scenes of Montréal. Paradis’ gifted capacity for melodic expression through complex tones began to blossom and caught the attention of the electronic scenes in the US and Europe. Before long, he was releasing albums on labels like Kernkrach (Germany) and Wierd (New York) and by 2006 he assumed the new alias, Automelodi. Since then his discography has expanded to include full-lengths, EPs and collaborations with artists like Liz Wendelbo of Xeno and Oaklander as the duo Liz and László. Paradis further elevated his poignant compositions with the addition of Dillion Steele on guitar in 2015, resulting in a refined and unique lexicon that continues to evolve. On Mirages, Paradis has sharpened his creative process and composed an innovative collection of songs with broad appeal and a fundamentally experimental core. Bursts of vibrant textured percussion and effects-driven guitar on “Feux rouges, Châteaux brillants” illustrate the extensive level of detail put into each and every element on the record. The emotional and conceptual palate of each track is carefully articulated with precise instrumental timbre, translating ineffable ideas and giving Mirages distinct character and sound. The luscious string pads and ghostly sound effects of “Angoisses d’Orléac” interplay with layers of sequenced synthesizers, addictive vocal melodies and an explosive energy of bass and rhythm. Friend and collaborator Liz Wendelbo is featured on the ominously seductive duet “Les Métros disparus” elegantly highlighting why these two talented veterans have maintained an international following for over a decade. Paradis’ longevity as Automelodi has enriched the caliber of his work and heightened Mirages to a level of sophistication scarcely achieved in pop music. Automelodi once again makes a lasting impression on the world of avant-garde synth-pop with Mirages au futur verre-brisé, transcending limitations of genre while creating catchy and compelling art from start to finish.” less"

One for fans of Nozomu Matsumoto’s playful arrangements and the kerned rhythms of Foodman “Max Allison co-runs the label Hausu Mountain and performs as part of the improvisational Chicago noise group Good Willsmith with Natalie Chami (TALsounds) and Doug Kaplan (MrDougDoug). SD Biomix is his new solo recording under the name Mukqs, and while still rooted in improvisation, it feels increasingly like microscopic moment-to-moment sound collage music, where dedicated listening is rewarded. Some surprising compositions rise out of Max’s process, like the beautiful harmonic opening to “Distributing Mementos” that abruptly cuts into MIDI slap bass, horn, and drum machine, or the intricate mixture of melody and free rhythm on “Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow”. The seven minute “All Seven Gods of Fortune” contains many of the albums concepts in one piece, starting with rhythmic patterns and chopped MIDI melodies that seem connected but fractured, as if a pop song has been blasted apart and then melded back together with each piece in a random order. I might have a biased view, but the album sits beside the new school of Japanese electronic artists like toiret status, Koeosaeme, DJWWWW, and Foodman (who Max referenced as an influence). They share a joy in discovery and show how this electronic language can achieve depth through playfulness and experimentation.” less"

   "name": "Sam Kerridge meets Taylor Burch (DVA Damas) for a surreal, slowly encroaching album of hyper, scudding, industrial music with vocal narration in spacious, theatrical space. The effect is something like listening to Autechre’s Anti EP intersected with shards of broken junglist edits and overlayed with a dystopian, bladerunner-esque vocal inspired by Jean Cocteau. This one benefits strongly from volume - play loud. Opening his sound up to kindred spirits, and allowing more space and time for his sounds to take hold, ‘The Other’ locates a newfound sense of nuance and context in Kerridge’s music. His arrangements here feel more layered and ductile, finely consolidating the gloomy slow pressure of his earliest work for Horizontal Ground with the uptick in pace and rabid energy found on 2017/2018’s ‘The Silence Between Us’ and ‘The I Is Nothing’. The adaptation is necessary as the music now accounts for half of an AV live project with Daisy Dickinson and also needs to accommodate Taylor Burch’s startling vocal delivery. In the process Kerridge is pushed to rethink and reframe his sound after seven years squashing and pummelling listeners into submission. As Taylor Burch takes centre stage in the narrator’s role, Kerridge becomes a kinetic presence, navigating her thru the tightest ginnels between cinematic sound design, industrial techno, broken D&B and dark ambient, or setting her in stark sonic lighting and backdrops like a dramaturgist watching from the wings. Kerridge’s impulses are reassuringly aggressive, but he’s clearly taken the opportunity to step back, review his sound, and recalibrate the mechanics, returning industrial music back to a multi-sensory conception of theatre and ‘The Other’, rather than straight-up sensory immolation - which is still key to his music, but now tempered and balanced with more complex ideas in mind. From the hybrid of icy vox with billowing tech-step bass and scudding percussion in the opening piece, thru the finely executed nods to classic mid ‘90s Autechre in ‘Transmission 5’, to the hyper, side-winding brilliance and synapse-firing intensity of the final ‘Transmission 7’, longer term followers of Kerridge’s work will be rewarded in spades with this thistly bouquet, while newcomers will want to dive into his swelling catalogue. less"

   "name": "Nathan Micay pursues the ‘Akira’ manga obsession of his Bwana EP ‘The Capsule’s Pride’ into speculative fictional zones with ‘Blue Spring’, reimagining the pivotal Castlemorton Common rave of 1992 as clash between “a young data miner rebel… and the ranks of a futuristic police state” at a woodland party in the future. To be fair, there won’t be any woods to hold a rave in the future anyway, so maybe he’s referring to the plastic foliage of festivals like Dekmantel? Anyway, Micay manifests his ideas in glorious HD across ‘Blue Spring’, reframing classic early ‘90s rave tropes in a super shiny, super earnest manner that sounds like was it was made on Protools in 1999. \"The impeccable craft found in the huge past anthems that fuelled his rise is still present, but Micay has upped his own ante; a prodigious and natural creator, this is his best work yet. Highly melodic with complex but spacious sound design, this inspired work is a technicolour ride across sub bass, celestial future breakbeat, drum-roll-fuelled dancefloor rollercoasters, soaring euphoria, otherworldly soundscapes, weightless sino and even a bit of ¾ time. Micay has found a sweet-spot between prog, trance, techno, hardcore, jungle, IDM and ambient, in a renewed twist on the magic mix that birthed Future Sound of London’s hybrid classic ‘Accelerator’. To create the album artwork, Nathan wrote a script outline, which was adapted by Peter Marsden into a comic, in turn illustrated by Dominic Flannigan, in tribute to the highly-influential Manga artist Katsuhiro Otomo. The comic sees a young data miner rebel by attending a rave in the woods with her friends, only for the event to be broken up by the ranks of a futuristic police state. ‘Blue Spring’ is the start of the revolution. With unnamed album tracks having already appeared on multiple RA mixes, Essential Mixes, Boiler Room sets, festival stages and dancefloors, music from this album has stealthily been whipping electronic music fans into a frenzy for some time, most notably in countless Shazams and posts on the Identification Of Music Facebook group.

Over the best part of a decade now, Adriani has issued a handful of tapes, CDs and vinyl as Newclear Waves, and more recently been noted for his smart refixes of Nico Fidenco’s Zombi Holocaust OST and Lata Ramasar’s hugely infectious TGNTL, all of course running in parallel to his duties behind the brilliant Mannequin node.

Night-lit autobahns and cannibal-infested schloss-scenes ensue from the widescreen intro of Fase Lunare I and ritual vibes of Verso lo Zenith; unfurling the sleek cosmic cruiser L’acquina di Nettuno and shades-on Munich pulse of Pianeta Rosso, before traversing the Alps to the airborne Badalamenti waltz of Attraverso le asperita and rolling into the zombie-gangster disco with Montagne Transparenti.

   "name": "A proper wiggy pop/punk fiesta compiled by Andy Votel & Doug Shipton, with liner notes by Andrew Weatherall, including a skronky DAF-like zinger by a pre 808 State Graham Massey in Beach Surgeons, and the wonky arps of ‘Jeep’ from Jerry & The Holograms “Greetings sisters and brothers. Let’s talk about reductionist revolution and the kicking in of doors. Let’s talk of iconoclasts and culture bombs. Let’s talk about moral panic and censorship. Let’s talk about punk rock. On second thoughts let’s not bother. The white noise is already deafening and actually, thinking about it, the Sex Pistols were really a heavy metal band with a funny singer and the whole shebang eventually, as all revolutions do, succumbed to conservative dogma and self parody. And anyway, as Dr Cooper Clarke said, “punks were just hippies with zips”. Instead, sisters and brothers, let’s talk about the dangerous counterrevolutionaries who went out and bought a cheap synth and a rudimentary drum machine. The ones that got what ‘punk’ was really about. The democratization of art. A democratization unhindered by rules concerning the means of production. A democratization forged in the blazing fire of unrestricted influence. A democratization free of perceived notions of “talent”. Sniffing Glue said learn three chords and form a band, Throbbing Gristle said why learn any chords at all… I am an artist because I say I am. More Marcel Duchamp than Malcolm McClaren. So, sisters and brothers, who do you think led the counter-revolution? Well I’ll tell you. It was the man who stormed the Bastille and kicked the door down in the first place and he did it on the 16th July 1977. With the help of Tommy Vance. John Lydon’s playlist that night on Vance’s show included Tim Buckley, The Creation, Augustus Pablo, Bobby Byrd, Neil Young, Lou Reed, Peter Hammill and Can and put paid to any punk rock “year zero” claims. Meanwhile, locked out of the studio, Malcolm had to listen to the counterrevolutionary manifesto being broadcast across the metropolis. Mark that date in your diaries, sisters and brothers: 16th July, the anniversary of the birth of “post punk”. Just over a year later in October, Lydon rammed the point home with the release of Public Image, a personal and musical manifesto in 7” form. The music on Plastic Dance 2 is the strangely coloured, distorted and frighteningly beautiful fruit of the seeds planted on that fateful day. Lessons learned and inspiration taken from the sonic aesthetics of dub, knowing that not all disco sucked and that even jazz was allowed. Music shaped by wonky approximation and appropriation. The artists on Plastic Dance 2 were artists because they said they were. Listen to their work and you’ll know they were. Listen in transcendent wonderment as George Attwell creates alchemical space funk in his home studio… as a future Mock Turtle and members of The Manchester Music Collective channel Robert Calvert and Bill Nelson… as Korzynski comes on like a Jeff Mills remix of Terry Riley. Listen in the wide-eyed joy of being as Stabat Stable’s drum machine runs amok to the accompaniment of discordant organ stabs… as a future founder of 808 State channels Albert Ayler alongside a galloping synth arpeggio. I’ll stop right there, brothers and sisters, as crass comparison does this art no justice. Let it trigger your own parallel universe because the music on Plastic Dance 2 is the sound of yesterday, today and tomorrow. - Andrew Weatherall” less"

   "name": "Insanely fresh, killer debut volley by 19 year old “veteran” of Lisbon’s virulent ghetto sound, recorded when he was just 14 and now remastered and released by the mighty Príncipe. It's a brilliantly weirdo, avant-garde fusion of portugese/angolan dance music styles championing an ideal of dance music as punkish & direct rather than overworked and generic. Hot out of Lisbon’s ghetto sprawl, 19 year old Puto Tito breaks thru on Príncipe with 20 tracks produced when he was barely into his teens, all salvaged from an old Soundcloud account and newly remastered for the dance. The sound of ‘Carregando a Vida Atrás das Costas’ is patently influenced by Tito’s Angolan heritage, and faithfully employs the popular slow Tarraxho and tougher Kuduro rhythm styles. Yet, like the best of Príncipe’s releases, it’s the way he injects a playful, weirdo character and uncompromising, psychedelic vision to his trax that sets Tito’s music apart form the crowd, whilst being very much connected to it. With a direct fervour and naturally experimental quality to his productions, the album scales from drowsy, red-eyed, to brightly coloured downbeats on one hand, while charging into jagged and nagging uptempo styles on the other hand. But whichever way he goes, it’s always with an off-the-cuff flair and rhythm-lead suss that works the dance to its best. The 2LP highlights the full spectrum of Puto Tito’s early remit, diving in with the darkside drone and rasping rhythm of ‘Noite Magica’, to swerve from the celebratory, drop-top cruise of ‘Mestre Das Artes’ thru to wickedly screwed Tarraxho in ‘Malucao’ and the deadpan drag of ‘1 2 3’, while he can hardly suppress his brilliant, weirdo tendencies in the zig-zagging arps of ‘C L Prod’, the heat-warped funk of ‘OIHo JoOnAe’, and the heatsick, syrupy pressure of ‘Locura Tutal’. Further, the digital bonuses extend the wigged-out fun in seven short, sharp shots, slipping farther down the rabbit hole into a bittersweet beatless flex on ‘Melodia daquelas’ alongside the hypnotic uptempo styles of ‘ABuzaNtesS’. Tito’s arguably and understandably naif approach speaks to an ideal of dance music as punkish, fresh and direct, rather than overworked and generic. It’s an approach that, in the past, has yielded some of the finest underground music, from the UK’s early ‘90s hardcore and jungle, to South Africa’s Gqom scene, Chicagoan footwork and the Singeli sound of Dar-Es-Salaam. More specifically, its possible to place Puto Tito in the same dare-to-be-different, bedroom producer category of grimy Kuduro, Batida and Afrohouse as young heroes Nídia or P.Adrix, as ‘Carregando a Vida Atrás das Costas’ vividly demonstrates.

   "name": "An incredible 80 minute wormhole into ritualistic, hypnagogic experiments from riveting dark ambient to freezing rave riffs and SAW II-like tone poems. Puts so much of this kind of music to shame - if you’re into the darker, more harrowing end of drone and Ambient - anything from Kevin Drumm to Dean Hurley or Thomas Köner, this will rule your world. Key Hospital Productions artist Jim Mroz aka Lussuria ditches the synths for a holistically organic, analogue alchemy in ‘Scarlet Locust of These Columns’, anticipating the mighty shadow of his ‘Three Knocks’ album looming on the horizon. Assembled and executed in 10 days of October and finally realised at Merchant House, South Hampton, Long Island, New York, the album locates Lussuria in elemental and liminal states. Gathering a charged array of instrumentation including flutes made out of human leg bones and a drum made from a skull, he conducts ritualistic experiments that enable him to broach other dimensions and relay the what’s on the other side in a series of riveting dark ambient tales and hypnotic pulses. It’s maybe wisest to take ‘Scarlet Locust of These Columns’ as an initiatory rite of passage for the upcoming ‘Three Knocks’ album. In structure and scale, its 17 tracks are perhaps surprisingly light on the ear, and as hypnagogic as they are impending, vacillating the pressure meter between sky citadel structures in the title track and the choking pound of ’Neo-Savage (Suspicions of Destiny)’ with heavy-lidded wormholes such as ‘With Bated Breath (Bird in Hand)’, segueing from somnambulant shoegaze in ‘Mondala (The Snell Of Power)’ to dry-eyed choral samples in ‘The Mondrian’, and sublime, opiated gauze in ‘White Ties To The Revolution’, or seemingly isolating and freezing rave riffs in meditative space on ‘Feather Duster Put In Place’, beside SAW II-like tone poems and exquisite palls of inclement gloom.

Unfolding in two durational halves, ‘Merry Peers’ appears to be an ironic moniker for the duo’s modest, coy and quiet style of composition. Using Henkel’s trumpet, plus synth, daubs of voice, and carefully applied FX, they form a microcosm unto themselves, one that takes in three minutes of visceral extended technique and piercing high register tones, before fading into the thing proper - a sublime arc of ambient synth pads infiltrated by blithe self-help slogans, and leading down the garden path to phosphorescing blooms of dubwise, 4th world jazz, Vangelis-like synth brass flares, and dilapidated ambient-pop song. The effect is richly dreamlike comfortingly lonely, and smudged in all the right places for a perfectly elusive grip on the duo’s waking reality, stemming for the immersion in Berlin’s fecund underground. There’s no real big statement or difficult concept behind ‘Merry Peers’, just a wry expression of the strangeness and melancholy of the human condition that will surely resonate with daydreamers and lovers of anything from Felicia Atkinson or Teresa Winter. less"

The film follows the tale of Romi, a Japanese woman living in the suburbs of Paris with her paraplegic lover Milou. Told through personal anecdotes and myths, the story soon turns ominous, reflected as the narrated story and the visual story diverge to reveal an ambiguous space which is subtly coloured and accentuated by the soundtrack’s suggestive daubs of ambient electronics and burnished instrumental tones. The music was composed during the editing of the film, mostly by Tujiko, but with integral assistance from both Sam Britton and Will Worsely, and her co-director Joji Koyama. Perhaps glibly known as “the Japanese Björk” for her spellbinding, etheric touch, Tujiko brings a wealth of experience to helm in the soundtrack, steering fathoms wide of her pop-related output to work with filigree, layered electronics, organs that are occasionally and imperceptibly meshed with diegetic, rustling sounds from the film. The resulting atmosphere is intoxicatingly gentle yet elusive, evoking themes of claustrophobia and haunting beauty that also lie behind the imagery. In the film, Tujiko is heard as the narrator behind Romi, but in this soundtrack release her voice is largely reserved to scant, poignant moments of glossolalia or breathy presence, save for one exquisite piece of ambient pop. Nested at the core of ‘Kuro’ is ‘Romi Sings’, where Tujiko appears to duet with the breeze from her window in the album’s most gorgeous vignette. Taken part of the whole, it’s a hauntingly realist denouement for the rest of the soundtrack, and just one of the subtly absorbing, contrasting components that make up the album’s dreamlike nature. ‘Kuro (OST)’ is an ideal first release for Entopia, the soundtrack-focussed offshoot of PAN. Taking its meaning in context of Ekistics - the idea of world-building - and in respect of creative communities both visual and music-oriented, Entopia proposes a promising new space - neither utopian nor dystopic - where the boundaries between installation works, theatre, dance and fashion will fall, just as they have with PAN the parent label. less"

   "name": "Almighty sophomore album by industrial overload Kris Lapke aka Alberich - Hospital Productions’ mastering engineer, scene-defining producer, and right hand man to Dominick Fernow (Prurient, Vatican Shadow, RSE). Where Alberich’s infamous, 3 hour long ‘NATO Uniformen’ [2010] series can be heard as a cornerstone for this decade’s tilt into noise techno experimentation, its follow-up is a bitterly refined and exquisitely crafted single disc bedevilled by increasingly excoriating detail via bombed-out rhythms and eschaton-limning atmospheres. Lapke distills and pokes his most potent ideas into their most succinct, brutalist forms, but also makes room for one durational pulverizer that is on its own worthy of the cost of admission. A master of calibrating maximalist and minimalist scopes, Lapke has a gift for getting right in-the-mix and pulling sounds to the biting point or allow them to glisten in the periphery; emphasising their grotesqueness, stark beauty and visceral nature in the process. It’s an approach which has elevated him to the vanguard of modern industrial music, evidenced in production work and mastering for Prurient, The Haxan Cloak and Nothing, as well as audio restoration for COUM Transmissions and Shizuka, but rarely felt as strongly or as nuanced as in his solo work. Between opener ‘Upper Mountains’, casting some of the gloomiest synth pads this side of Silent Servant’s ‘Negative Fascination’, to the entrenched techno of ‘Unity House’ with its asphyxiating, buried-by-mud effect buoyed only by drily resigned vocals, and the aching synth poignancy of ‘No Reference to The Absence of Allegory’ at the album’s charred heart, Lapke's sounds adopt a frightening meaning thru their manacled grip of reality. But its the B-side that will really see off any half-hearted types, as he sucks us down the title track’s rabbit hole of collapsing techno and lo-NRG vox into the reverberating negative space of ‘Freeze’, and the masterfully dense yet wide open paradox of his closing ‘Radio Op’ transmission. less"

We serendipitously stumbled across ‘Eyes’ via searches for Pink Industry some years back, and it’s a joy to now see it properly available. Written and released by Alex Twin and Lilian Vaz’ cult band in 1993, it’s a perfectly icy mixture of early trip hop, ambient-pop and shoegaze lit up with Lilian’s achingly spot-on vocal, which, for us, defines a dark ‘90s sexiness we can’t get enough of. 100% essential! \"In the lead up to part two of the highly anticipated Outro Tempo compilation, MFM drops this teaser EP with the never before heard cassette madness of São Paulo’s Bruhahá Babélico and Individual Industry’s ethereal electro pop on the flip.

   "name": "50th anniversary edition of a real beauty by Harry Partch - newly expanded with candid bonus material - locating the endlessly explorative American composer and instrument builder at the peak of his creative powers in the mid ‘60s. \"'In late 1962 Harry Partch returned to California and began a project that would not only become the bones of a masterwork, Delusion of the Fury, but have a life of its own. In a too-small space within an abandoned Petaluma chick hatchery, Partch gathered the instruments he had designed and built -- new and old -- eager to once again expand the boundaries of his compositional fabric. He learned each individual part as he composed, establishing that it could be played. And On The Seventh Day Petals Fell In Petaluma (1963-64, rev. 1966) was born of his exploration and assembled with that 'minimum of players' over a three-year period. In spite of rough conditions and meager resources Partch's dogged persistence, along with the efforts of his dedicated assistants, eventually succeeded in realizing the 34 verses of expanded duets. With this album we revisit an important work and turning-point, guided by the original 'Statement' Partch wrote for the first commercial release of the piece. Previously only excerpted, it is a voicing of his beliefs that transcends one project to illuminate an entire purpose. We also reprise exquisite notes by the late Bob Gilmore, who distills and explains the story of Petals so clearly and eloquently. No one wants a dead reissue, so by digging into the archives, I am pleased to offer hidden gems. First, The Petals Sessions is an aural glance into the cramped quarters of the recording space, as composer and players labor to bring new notes to life, Harry himself giving direction. The montage ends with a 'test take' by Danlee Mitchell and Michael Ranta that could have easily been a keeper! Finally, we present the original Verse 17. In 1964 Partch wrote two duets that used the Adapted Viola; by the time the piece was finished in 1967, he had excised them. The ending track -- never before released -- brings Harry back to life, playing and recording Adapted Viola for one of the last times. I was completely unaware of this recording until I examined the outtakes and it glows, fifty years on. That Petals ever came to be, like much of Partch's story, stands somewhere between determination and miracle.' -- Jon Szanto, The Harry Partch Foundation\" less"

Still, the track remains all too short, so we’d advise picking up two copies to extend the pleasure in-the-mix. Also worth mentioning that the others are all killer, neatly playing into Jeff’s minimalist and mysterious side between the iridescent scales and slinky groove of ‘As Soon As’, the deep space psychedelia of ‘G-Star’, and the bugged-out Detroit drive of ‘Cycle 30 (Loop4)’. less"

It’s probably fair to say that Helm has subsumed his sound into Decimus’ tendency for sprawling jams, in the tradition of his numerous volumes for Kelippah, Planam and Further Records. Both sides play thru as one long track; in the first instance, Any Surface Will Do they curl out a soggy, sloppy pulse rent with arrhythmic concrète apparition and voices that recall either operator’s work at their most fetid and creepy, rolling up to a final passage of gremlin-in-the-machine blackened metal techno. On the other side they start out more opiated, with the sound of a reverberating bell chime summoning imagery of a lone buoy bobbing in the calm before a storm, which starts to come on with force before burying us at sea in a whirlpool of submerged techno and drowned howl. less"

It’s a productive partnership that has yielded numerous albums for the likes of Eat Concrete and ALTER as well as multiple Opal offerings, including last year’s Transmissions From Revarsavr. Under his own name, Taeggi also released the Mama Matrix Most Mysterious LP on Type two years ago. The same intensive level of detail found in the Lumisokea productions permeates Miccaotli, with Taeggi’s distinctive rhythmic approaches and sound palette making this a release as engaging as it is adventurous. Clattering, mutant breakbeat flaring flirts with zippy synthesis on “Huehueteotl” before the more intimate shuffle and rattle of “Cipacti”, its kitchen sink percussion falling prey to crafty edits and FX swells. “Tlaloc” grows from sparse beginnings to meet with stark lead hooks that shine out amongst the razor sharp beat programming. Hyper-modern breakbeat science looms once more on Side B opener “Quetzalcoatl”, and continues apace into the intricate roll of “Miccaotli”, where dazzling daubs of synths splay out between the urgent thrust of the drums. “Tezontle” closes proceedings with a snaking approach that equally champions infinitesimal sound design and hard-rocking, idiosyncratic groove. There’s a consistent style that shapes out Miccaotli, and it once again demonstrates the great technical skill Taeggi is capable of deploying in the studio. Fortunately the results of his endeavours are as utterly thrilling to listen to as they are advanced.” less"

   "name": "Acre presents a new digestion of technologically advanced cyber-grime on the ‘Hollow Body’ album, a ten track answer to the age old question “when will the robot kill me?”. \"Earlier music on Tectonic, Codes and Brainmath has solidified Acre’s music as a station of future ready bass music. This issue through Opal Tapes, takes the trans-humanist art of Stelarc, the rattling of kinetic sculptures and reductions of the grime sound palette into new direction entirely. Collectively ‘Hollow Body’ is both a warmer and more fleshed out face to Acre’s work while also taking the statuesque sound design and bone shaking bass of his productions into new spaces. Opening track ‘Trial 6’ degenerates into error and computer pollution before huge sheets of brightly resonating plastic synth sail off like Steve Roach playing the most ambient of Eski-beat in some unknown void. Signatures of error and failed translation continue in ‘Android’, a signal sent to re-awaken an earlier version of your metal self. ‘Suicide Drone’ plays with sample-rate in a kaleidoscope of broken glass and blast a part-gabber, part-industrial jack hammer into your head. ‘Glow’ and ‘Direct Registering’ close out the first side with a Chain Reaction-esque procession of flickering zero points, stubbed out chords and fluttering visions recalling the plastic bins behind the call centre. Something beings to unspool as b-side opens with ‘Hollow Body’, sub-wobbles under lay a stumbling loop of disembodied voice. Guns are out for ‘DNT’ as the metal body which was earlier awoken, dresses and arms itself. All the forward momentum of bass music is inverted into a lumbering swagger replete with cyborg horn. ‘Taking Over’ offers a soft relief of aliasing tones clashing into each other like fucking modems before ‘Second Escape’ stokes the fire once again in an obliterating crush of noise percussions and jewel like synths. Closing track ‘External’ is the desert, the dust of the universe. After the earlier crush everything has to settle and fall back down.” less"

Those unique instruments were recorded at Berlin’s Generation Z: Renoise exhibition in 2014 and form the basis for seven supple, dynamic constructions operating at the border between dance research, concrète sculpture and electro-acoustic experiment. Thanks to Russia’s totalitarian government, which emerged in the 1930s and strove to erase or censor the endeavours of its experimental music community, we’ll never quite know how those early instruments were used. But, in the hands of Andrea Taeggi and Koenraad Ecker, they’re boldly chopped and processed, along with the duo’s foundational influences - outernational drumming, dub, concrète - to resemble Shackleton or Photek-style percussive rituals crossing paths with Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe’s modular tangles, Lowjack’s tribal ciphers, or the tactile tonal explorations of Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza.

Bravo, SP. This is blowing our minds right now! “American composer and multi-instrumentalist Alvin Curran has remained one of the great emblems of experimental music for the last half-century. In 1966, along with Frederic Rzewski and Richard Teitelbaum, Curran co-founded Musica Elettronica Viva, a seminal gesture in collective free improvisation. In the early '70s, his solo work would become a crucial bridge between minimalist traditions on both sides of the Atlantic. Canti E Vedute Del Giardino Magnetico, Curran's solo debut, was recorded by the artist himself and issued on Ananda, the small Italian imprint started by Curran and fellow composers Giacinto Scelsi and Roberto Laneri. The piece itself was put together in the winter of 1973 and presented for the first time at Teatro Beat 72 (Rome's The Kitchen). Encouraged by the work of Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Charlemagne Palestine and Simone Forti, Curran binds the listener to aberrant notions of place and time: blending field recordings (wind, high-tension wires, beach waves, etc.) with simple and often primitive instruments. Across two sidelong tracks, Giardino Magnetico forms a lyrical collage of synthesizer, glass and metal chimes, plastic tubes, brass and the composer's alluring voice – converging in an immersive realm of Curran’s inner / outer experiences. This first-time vinyl reissue is recommended for fans of Harry Bertoia, Michel Redolfi and Lino Capra Vaccina.” less"

BGFT sounds something like Rhythmic Theory meets early Deep Teknologi, all rotund subs, soca snare patterns and sleek tech-house hi-hats with minimalist but banging synth progressions; the tribalism shunt of Inner Another could almost be from Roska’s 2011 folder; and Handle Broker comes off like Karizma meets Ben Klock at burger king, 7am.

   "name": "Slacker no wave punk-funk bridging the gap betwixt The Fall and Liquid Liquid “The latest release from D.U.D.S. is a deepening of the sinister sonic territory they have been exploring, in various forms, since they formed. Bass lines and percussion lope through the undergrowth while jagged guitars pierce the ears. Then there’s the brass section, which works less as a means of driving home a song’s point, than as a warning that whatever comes next is unlikely to be anything you expect. Lyrics are still somewhat hard to make out, emerging from the rhythmic chaos at intervals, as though you were listening to the recording of an Old Testament prophet, preaching from the ruins of the twenty first century. I don’t know what kind of band D.U.D.S. are supposed to be. There are labels you could apply to them, terms like ‘wave’ and ‘punk’ with various prefixes designed to qualify the fact that they don’t really sound like anyone else. Immediate makes that fact all the more obvious and all the more compelling. Sometimes you catch something unexpected which resets a switch, excites and engages. I caught D.U.D.S. a couple of years ago on a whim, they were visiting Newcastle supporting their debut album. I had never heard them or of them but the moment their perfectly disjointed music hit the room, I was all smiles. Warping brass shapes through the room entwined with guitars played as percussively as they are melodically, the whole sound coalesces into a rolling ball of spiked energy. Their take on punk rock welds the caustic atonality of The Fall to the coiled funk of Liquid Liquid. Both drenched in negative information and loaded with dance floor impact. Lyrically themes explore the human condition a lurching dread and this dichotomy of no-wave funk and the lyrical creep is the hook the grabs me/you/us and forces a regular return.” less"

He tends to a moonlit garden of decaying roses in Presence of Light whilst the glum thump and sore feel As A Sea Creature Might Watch From The Aquarium prompts comparison with Lussuria and The Sight Below. Radiance and Instability finds him reaching for the sweetest strains of eldritch neofolk synth music, and in heavenly electro-acid-dub realms with The Shelves of Gravel, which sounds uncannily alike moments from The Connection Machine’s Painless album. less"

   "name": "The artist f.k.a. Cosmin TRG tests out textured ambient techno abstractions for Opal Tapes on his latest release as Cosmin Nicolae “Over the last decade the work of Cosmin Nicolae has been a cresting force of forward thinking electronic music. His TRG alias formed the inaugurate release on the peerless Hessle Audio with the Put You Down / Broken Heart 12” (HES001). His music has featured across Tempa, ~scape, 50 Weapons, Hotflush, the list goes on. In essence he forms an important part of the story of the cross pollination of UK “bass” music with techno and his hard work and craft has seen him maintain his fixture as a sought after talent, both producing and as a DJ. One element which always amplified his work beyond that of many other peers is Cosmin’s dedication to crafting interesting sound from scratch, a process which precedes his production and has it roots in home- brewed experimentation with instruments, electro-acoustic process and improvisation. With this debut release under his actual name, Opal Tapes has provided a space for Cosmin to have free reign to display another, looser and more experimental side of his repertoire. Opening track “Semnal” peers slightly at the UKG influence he has worn in his early career, the track swings forward, percussions align, but the palette of sound at use here is one of moist rustic underfloor. A forested garage, humid and rotten. “Demolare” is the first of several pieces which constrain to use an ultra-simple motif, on this occasion a bone-rattling formant beat which convolves and vibrates as gaseous synths light the way. “Simultan” evokes the Clicks & Cuts comps of yore, randomising and rearranging itself as modular systems attempt to speak a common language. “Sector Acuamarin” see’s honey sweet trembles and pin- sharp percussion dot around the stereo in another rural retreat from the science lab the remainder of the album often conjures. “Distors Util” once again revolves around the one take, the idea, allowed to bleat and operate alone in a conjured malfunction. Auxiliaries flow out to spring reverbs enriching the mass. Our A side closes with “Autopilot Escapism” where metallic membranes pip and pop atop a gorgeous perfume of digital choir, certainly one of the albums highest points. The B opens with “Secvente” where the factory is turned back on with just enough power to clear the damp. “Jos” thumbs an ugly beat of bleating module against a harrowed soundscape, pulling back the curtain just in time to see the machines start to really fry. Odd dub shapes are thrown around during “Vapori” before “Iele” bottoms out into a dread-scape of factory churn and gut-bumping delays as the whole damn Gamelan is thrown at hyper-speed into the blender to terrifying psychedelic effect. “Sulfuric” and “Swept” close the album out with a double down of acid-burn and defected skwee. In many ways, an impossible album to classify, it feels as if it’s creating itself at points. The ideas therein are the genesis of so many fully “functional” songs but hearing them like this brings us so much closer to someone else’s mind and fingertips.” less"

Whichever angle you come at it, this one should leave you ragged and gagging for another go, if you’re of the mutant persuasion. RIYL Eartheater, Aïsha Devi, The Body “Rarely does a debut release come with such a powerful impact as this, the self titled recording by AJA. Maximal in approach, AJA deploys rhythmic noise, bomb heavy drum machine, convolving vocal utterance and a dedicated hell-scape of field recordings, abrupt sound design and blistering drone. These recordings feel expelled rather than composed, a lashing of energy captured. The unhinged nature of her recorded work is complimented in what are soon becoming legendary live performances wherein the AJA experience is fully realised. As a collaborator with designer LU LA LOOP, AJA’s sounds have bruised the runway of Berlin Alternative Fashion Week. Her work within the LGBTQ community running workshops in sound art and as an advocate of promoting and increasing the presence of women in electronic music, has seen her work carry throughout Europe and more recently to Brazil. It is in within the context of transgressive art, sexual identity/ politic and grass roots teaching that AJA’s work is elevated into a neo-punk. The self-titled Opal Tapes release opens with the swaggering, drunken lurch of “Rattles”. Claustrophobically building toward release but never achieving, AJA’s voice dominates the track in an almost wordless epiphany which is re-digested by digital bacterium. “Charge” resonates in golden tone as pylon-heavy drones fry away above, the beat, still present; remains leaden, dragging it’s weight forward. “Sweat Pearls” is arrhythmic and paranoid, stuttering kick patterns charge out draped in psychotic wailing. The A side closes out with “XLR”, a mixed resolution of glorious sound design, crunching and clunking like ancient calculators while AJA’s voice soars above. “Tuck It, Tape It” offers minute respite before the immense energy of the B side begins it’s mission to excoriate. Breathlessly oscillating between high speed industrial ache and rubbered up cleaving, the track pushes toward palpitating levels of intensity. “Black Stain” gutturally digests to follow up, textured vocals push rich drones along while grim MS-20 sits low and stern rumbling the track forward. High energy reigns back in for closer “Marbles”. A seven minute flex over a delicate ambient backdrop which climbs up and over into a full on trance denial. AJA is cementing her place at the front of confrontational, psycho-visceral, truly new music. Opal Tapes are enormously proud to work with her on this full debut release. Her previous work can be heard on Perc’s album “Bitter Music” (track title “Spit”) and on the recent Opal Tapes compilation “The Harvest Of A Quiet Eye”. less"

Trust this is some of the ruddiest stuff in either producer’s catalogue of late, picked right from the back of the nose and smeared into six tracks of toxic effluence and clammy greyscale drone. The follow-up to their split tape Krig, featuring a side a piece from Celldöd and Varg under his Black Leather Harness alias - the 1st release on the former’s Brutal Disciplin label - yields a queasy, airless experience akin to industrial waterboarding, effectively drowning their spare, brittle and bony drum machine (machine drum?) rhythms under graded layers of granular silt, holding us under at the point where light only teasingly breaks through the surface. In that submerged half light they parlez in a language of mutant dolphin chatter and against banking walls of noise in Kennel Murder Case, whereas Starved To Death offers a gulf stream of relief of warmer ambient techno relief and Bitten brings back the coldest industrial currents. Turn it over and Elite Dogs of War tramples water with an agitated sense of purpose, followed by palpitating rhythmic noise recalling The Boats’ swerve into this realm c.

Dane Law’s jittering software recycles and accumulates, offering patterned beats and digitally crusted soundtrack. It’s both welcome and unwell.

It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(n log n). It is also easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random access. However, it has additional O(n) space complexity, and involves a large number of copies in simple implementations.” less"

   "name": "Industrial kosmische noise, new on Opal Tapes. “Beginning with childhood experiments using a cheap keyboard sampler & multi-track tape machine. The Subdermic created hypnotic loops, drawing her early influences from the New Romantic & New Wave era. Her teenage years were drenched with early Acid house and later Techno as both a listener and an emergent musician. This cultivated a growing collection of studio equipment from where she began to hone her sound. Interest in the work of Kosmiche pioneers Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream and the expansive, cinematic synth soundtracks of John Carpenter and Lustmord have all informed the Morphology EP, a debut release for The Subdermic on Opal Tapes. “Most of my music comes from a definitive idea or theme that I’m obliged to express, it’s like a sculpture, starting from a simple place the whole work ethic grows to become fevered and all encompassing. The most important part of writing & arrangement for me is the process of subtraction or sculpting the piece” This elegant, learned subtraction is evident here where over the six pieces all surfaces are worn down to reveal subtle detail or to erase the detail entirely. Opening track ‘Ballet of the Sutures’ daubs pointillistic synth against grinding metallics. Leering forwards the piece offers no solution just a see-sawing of trapped acid possibilities and oddly emotive ostinato. ‘Rage 1st Movement’ throws argumentative squeals of overdriven sound through the stereo, formants fold against clusters of noise and crushed breathing sounds. Doors bang and close for good, the whole track is trapped in it’s own smothering air. ‘An Upside Down’ ends the A-side with pure, horizonless, “Phaedra” like ambient built around deep, enwombing Jupiter 8 cycles. ‘God the Mind’ follows suit to start the B-side though this time the orbit is lower and the air thicker. Duelling lines of ever tightening oscillation coarse closer and closer in a devastating minimalism recalling Aube’s brain-scanner works. ‘Southern Sun’ is all delicious Jupiter and Juno in full Carpenter mode, majestic chords crashing against purring filters in a total sunrise of sound. The EP closes with ‘Of Moths and Butterflies’ where sequencers pluck melancholic arps and wings fill with blood for the first time. Future-retro perfection. Serene and sometimes scarring, minimal but eminently tuneful. This is the music of The Subdermic.” less"

   "name": "What would Dariush Dolat-Shahi’s Electronic Music, Tar And Sehtar classic sound like if he had access to a Serge modular and digital applications in 2016? That notion is beautifully answered in Sote’s remarkable Sacred Horror In Design, which was produced in Tehran, Iran as the sonic quota of an A/V collaboration with Tarik Barri, commissioned for a performance at the 2017 edition of Berlin’s CTM festival, and now picked up for this special release by the excellent Opal Tapes label. To more pertinently expand the question at the top; what if Dolat-Shahi had also come up listening to hardcore, techno and modern electronic music? Across six tracks that idea unfolds in gloriously beguiling fashion, rendering 45 minutes of the classic instruments - ancient forerunners of the ubiquitous guitar - sublimated into flourishing vamps and diaphanous clouds of complex harmonics which reprise the beauty of Dolat-Shahi’s music, but with a more dynamic keen and microtonal glisten that’s no doubt been inspired by the cultural restrictions of his home country, and also resonates with the fraught ambiguity of our times. It’s the latest and arguably most impressive example of Sote’s creative renaissance, presenting his definitive opus after a winding 15 years of work which has variously turned up on Warp in the early ‘00s, followed by a 7 years hiatus which saw him return with the Xenakis-at-the-rave styles of Architectonic and Arrhythmia for Morphine Records and Record Label Records, and a pair of staggering techno releases for Ge-stell and Opal Tapes in Hardcore Sounds From Tehran [2016]. Opening with the wide-eyed, vaulted dimensions of Flux of Sorrow, incorporating material from NOVA Ensemble’s Seyle Ashk, to vacillate serene pastoral motifs with panicked modular busts in Boghze Esfahan and the demented prangs of Plural, before lashing out with the intense rave brainfloss of Plebians and sweeping us up in the folk music advancement of Segaah, the meter-tearing Serge rushes of Holy Error’ provides a fitting, climactic closure to the album’s mind bending equations. It’s hard to think of another artist who has so uniquely pursued a synthesis of traditional and modern, sacred and arcane, with such vigour and vision in recent years, and for it all to remain so compellingly coherent is strong testament to Sote’s sorely under-regarded brilliance. less"

Despite early outings on the currently dormant (but soon to be revived) Forbidden Planet and Pat Marsman’s Pinkman, the fiendishly hard to pronounce Annanan have remained low on the radar of wider recognition within contemporary techno. Perhaps this outing on Black Opal will change that? Certainly, the title track possesses the sort of hazy charm we’ve come to expect from one of Terekke’s more focussed excursions. A real smudgers delight of a track, New Wave Of Nature blearily runs simple piano motifs over skittering drums to leave lo-fi techno selectors reaching for a box of tissues. Bomb comes from a similar place but springs a surprise with its midpoint deviation into dank sub bass science and sonically lives up to its title as a subsequent procession of airborne juggernauts rain down.

Second bit \"Eva's Blue Dream\" again builds around simple voice cuts left to hang in reverberant holiness while half-stepping cybernetics rattle away beneath like AI piecing dubstep back together. \"She Blinks Beside Me\" segues us into the b-side with saccharine arps of retuned something stuck in limbo and fluttering delicately. The dubstep cum dub-tech cum ambient glow of \"Ravishing Kitana\" is a enveloping sheet of GAS-esque beauty just allowed to become what it is and unfurl and unfurl taking things down and calming before \"Echoing Impact\" enters... The bots are back, mechanically devouring the stereo space and the choking side-chains again apply pressure to the head. There's swing and sway and all kinds of kinetic energy popping off as wave after wave keeps on crashing in but Evitceles holds the weight up with an ever more layered and detailed mid-range of percussions and that single pad of near hope which issues in the end.” less"

Arriving just ahead of a new Basic House album on Helm’s Alter label, Stephen Bishop’s late 2016 ‘Government’ album for Vanilla makes its way to the digital realm. In stark contrast to the previous Basic House album, 2014’s ‘Visa Prick’ which was described with typical self-effacement as a “bunch of shitty dance tracks,” Bish digs deep on this abstracted six-track collection of sound collage and metallurgist voodoo. Creeping out with Headstalking, Basic House conjures a swelling mass of metallic textures that evokes imagery of Tomorô Taguchi mid-rage metamorphosis into the Iron Man in Shinya Tsukamoto’s classic Tetsuo franchise. From here, both AAOA and the title track occupy the strata of post-dub techno, delivering a sense of rhythmic negative space that will thrill the more adventurous DJs out there, whilst Encase (Junked Edit) and C-Skin (Rupt Edit) align with the reduced sound design installations from Actress witnessed at Tate Modern. To round things off, Bish indulges his love of pop music with a haunting, dirt-crusted remulcification of Berlin’s Top Gun classic, Take My Breath Away. less"

From found sounds to ambient zones, junglist edits to distilled vocal narration reminiscent of Anne-James Chaton, the whole thing has a dystopian mixtape vibe that's both evocative and unsettling. Metta Sound Peace is the sound project helmed by Pierre Edouard Dumora, whose AV work has previously been shown at the Centre Pompidou and Yale Art Gallery. On ‘Zanclean’ he takes inspiration from the eponymous catastrophe event some 6 million years ago, when the Mediterranean basin was refilled by the Atlantic after 600,000 years as a salty stretch that allowed large mammals including primates to cross from North Africa into Europe. Dumora however sets this event in the future (a not so distant one, geologically-speaking), using a mixture of electronics, field recordings and voices - ranging from ASMR-like whispers and mouth sounds to scrambled text-to-speech and synthetic syrens - to limn this uncanny valley on the horizon. Like a messenger dialled back in time to the age of extinction rebellion with a cryptic tale to tell, ‘Zanclean’ speaks of a world populated with myths and non-human entities, where furtive, hacked-up voices inhabit shadowy ambient space, machine-like voices converse in scrambled code and crystalline arps, and lush jungle fantazias appear like Ballardian mirages, where his careful use of textures and editing conjures the feeling of a world in flux between states from extreme dryess to puckered, bittersweet and salty, and all with a fine grasp of the new, new age consciousness. less"

   "name": "First ever reissue of this Spiritual Jazz holy grail, remastered from the original tapes. \"Although his albums are full of the same qualities as those of many other star saxophonists / flutists playing spiritual jazz, Frenchman Michel Roques is often classed as a \"supporting artist\" or a \"musicians’ musician\", forever in the background, and often left out of the reference books. Adding to this lack of recognition is the fact that Michel Roques was seriously under-recorded: five albums as leader in a career of almost twenty years does not amount to much! Thankfully, in 1972, Pierre Barouh, boss of Saravah, records made up for the injustice by offering him the opportunity to record ''Chorus'' in studio, providing a continuity with the equally brilliant ''Safari'' made four years earlier. An ambitious work, ''Chorus'' owes much to the unusual ‘augmented’ rhythm section, the inner structure of which is none other than that used in the Parisian trio of pianist Mal Waldron at the end of the 1960s: namely Patrice Caratini on bass (completed by the cello of the amazing Jean-Charles Capon) and Franco Manzecchi on drums (seconded by the percussion of Humberto Canto). Another notable singularity is that Michel Roques had the excellent idea of excluding the piano, traditionally employed in this kind of context. This didn’t prevent ''Chorus'' from being played on French TV in 1973 with a piano replacing the cello, and a different voice reciting the beat-style poems of Nicole Roques, that of actor Jacques Degor, occasional collaborator with Jef Gilson but far less convincing than Bachir Touré, wisely chosen for this recording for his style inherited from Afro-American preachers and capable of holding his own with the wild improvisations. In its own way, ''Chorus'' is one of the key albums mixing free jazz and spoken word ‘à la française’. It is also a militant concept album which has lost nothing of its political force.\" less"

Most crucially, though, for all the ‘60s connotations with LSD and The Radiophonic Workshop references, plus the label’s own nods to Alejandro Jodorowsky and Laurie Anderson, the music feels fresh, operating in its own liminal temporality, rather than being cloyed by cliché.

   "name": "First ever anthology of Les Primitifs du Futur with new exclusive cover artwork by legendary comic book author Robert Crumb. \"Nicknamed the Primdufs, they are neither Smurfs nor cave dwellers, just a happy collective of musicians who always have their instruments at the ready. They all have an inexplicable passion for a musical genre that some could consider obsolete, outdated and antique: the French ‘valse musette’ (a kind of popular swing waltz music, ndlt). But let’s be clear, this has nothing in common with the smutty chords of popular balls and singalongs in little town halls, nor with the trills of another generation linked to names like Horner or Verchuren in afternoon tea dances. No, this is ‘bal musette’ with balls, genuine, virile, authentic, and athletic, which used to get the blokes and the birds jivingin the no-man’s land of demolished forts around what the Parisians call Paname. Seen like that it is easy to imagine that the Primitifs du Futur, for that is their name, enjoy carefully recreating in minute detail museum pieces from the pungent remains of past festivals. It is more than that. Because though these noble savages like rummaging around in 1920s Paris, they don’t shy away from including rhythms from all over the planet, rhumba from Zaireto, gypsy jazz, Hindu waltzes or Argentine tango, blues, ‘paso doble’ or ‘chanson réaliste’. It all began in 1986, when Dominique Cravic, ‘’ukukeke’’ champion and a renowned guitarist who learned from jazzmen like Lee Konitz or Larry Coryell and also played with Georges Moustaki and Henri Salvador, met a certain Robert Crumb. Yes, the legendary comic book author from the great days of the US psychedelic underground in the 70s, the creator of Fritz the Cat and Mr Natural in person, the same man who also created the cover for ‘’Cheap Thrills’’ by Janis Joplin. Crumb plays banjo and mandolin, collects 78 sof blues, jazz and… musette. The two cronies then composed their own made-to-measure orchestra, alongside many famous names including accordionist Daniel Colin, clarinettist Bertrand Auger, saxophonist Daniel Huck, bassist Jean-Philippe Viret or singer Claire Elzière (sorry, it’s impossible to name them all). This great group has recorded four albums since 1986 (all with sleeves drawn by Crumb), some including guest stars such as Pierre Barouh, Jean-Jacques Milteau, AllainLeprest, Sanseverino or Olivia Ruiz. For thirty years, the Primitifs du Futur have carried the torch of musette to the four corners of the earth, from fiestas to festivals, and today release a double vinyl, entitled ‘Résumé des épisodes précédents’ which brings together the best of their adventures. It is a refreshing and heartening cocktail of ‘’world tribal musette’’, as they call it, which, in these electro digital times, has a rejuvenating effect, amagic swing potion. Les Primitifs du Futur take us back to the future. ‘’THE PRIMITIFS DU FUTUR travel on sound waves back in time to the early twentieth century and make the world seem like a far better place than it ever actually was. I cant get the band's music off my turntable or out of my head. Accordion, mandolin, harmonica, saxophone, musical saw, and beautiful haunting melodies—what’s not to love? Even their sad songs make me happy.’’ Art Spiegelman. less"

   "name": "Yves De Mey untangles presets with remarkable harmonic variation via the Modor NF-1, a new polyphonic digital DSP synth developed in Antwerp by Marcel Belmans. If you’re into Autechre - this is a must. An experimental study in getting the most from a single instrument, ‘Exit Strategies Part 1’ finds De Mey wrestling with the machine in eight parts. Using only a single preset in each cut, he pushes their forms to reveal slight harmonic mutations and in the process focus on the tangible quality of the resulting sound. From the slippery rhythms and harpsichord like twang of ‘Track 01’ to the boiling noise of ‘Track 02’, thru to proper, curdled Ae dimensions in ‘Track 03’ and ‘Track 04’, the variation is remarkable and just keeps on evolving with the empty-belly beastly growl of ‘Track 05’ and ‘Track 06’, before opening out into calligraphic murmurations on ‘Track 07’, and needling hi-register tones in ‘Track 08’. The results also somehow recall Theo Burt’s ‘Gloss’, itself an experiment on a single synth which yielded captivating results, and proved in the process - in key with Mark Fell’s mantra - that you really don’t need a studio stacked with vintage analog gear to make unique sounds. If you like the idea of an artist wriggling themselves out of self-imposed straitjackets, this album will almost certainly push your buttons. less"

   "name": "A number of albums on the Saravah label, by artists such as Steve Lacy, Areski, Maurice Lemaître, Philippe Maté, Jean-Charles Capon, Michel Roques or the Cohelmec Ensemble, are considered amongst the most important of the 1960-1970s, including, for example Comme à la radio by Brigitte Fontaine with the Art Ensemble of Chicago in Paris, 1969. \"It is unfortunately less well-known that the label produced a single at the same time also featuring the Art Ensemble of Chicago who this time backed the poetry of the little-remembered Alfred Panou. Seen in the 1967 film Week-end by Jean-Luc Godard where he played the role of a black garbage collector, Alfred Panou who is of mixed Benin-Togolese origin, already had a career as an actor in political theatre when, pushed by producer Pierre Barouh, he recorded two of his texts concerning Black Power. At the time of the recording the explosive first album by the Last Poets had not yet been made, nor that of their west coast counterparts the Watts Prophets which would only appear in 1971. This explains why, in 1969, even if the Black Dada Nihilismus by Amiri Baraka published four years earlier was incontestably the reference point of all the above, the combative prose of Alfred Panou had a real impact. This is heightened by the fact that it is also one of the first, in its own way, to question the notion of black identity. In order to do so the brilliant idea was to have the rowdy poly-instrumental jungle fantasy of the Art Ensemble of Chicago as a musical counterpoint! Little-recognised, probably because the texts are in French, Je suis un sauvage / Le Moral nécessaire deserves to be more than just a sought-after rare groove. Even today the record should not be neglected as it is a seminal and skilfully militant recording, which even had moments of humour. Though brief (barely ten minutes in total), it deserves to be considered as a key moment in Great Black Music in the same way as Seize The Time by Elaine Brown, Nation Time by Joe McPhee, There's A Riot Goin' On by Sly & The Family Stone or Attica Blues by Archie Shepp. No less than that.\" less"

   "name": "Deadbeat & Camara come like it’s dub night at the Roadhouse with a bewitching remake of Cowboy Junkies’ classic ‘The Trinity Sessions’, full of lounging, ethereal vocals underlined by rich dub bass and drowsy guitars, fittingly for Canada’s Constellation “Trinity Thirty is a celebration and reinterpretation of the much beloved Cowboy Junkies classic The Trinity Session, on the occasion of the album’s 30th anniversary (originally released in late 1988). The idea was spawned when Berlin-based Canadian producer Scott Monteith — best known as DJ and dub-inflected minimal techno-electronica recording artist Deadbeat — heard the Junkies’ Trinity version of “Sweet Jane” playing in an airport a few years back. Viscerally reminded of how much he loved the album, and how surprisingly overground the record ended up becoming (by mid-1989 The Trinity Session would be certified Platinum in both Canada and The United States – truly another era!), Monteith immediately reached out to the band to ask if they had anything planned to mark its 30th birthday. Before Monteith even touched down back in Berlin, the band had replied saying they had no such plans but would enthusiastically support whatever angle Monteith/Deadbeat might want to run with.” Initially imagining they would run a fair amount of electronic treatments during the mix, Deadbeat and Camara instead found themselves absorbed by the spaces, silences and atmospherics, guided by a spirit of preservation and restraint in further homage to the original. The result is “a less electronic album than we imagined making”: a gorgeous somnambulant collection of ‘covers of covers’, where the reference point is always the Cowboy Junkies original approach, stretched to new and beguiling limits of deceleration and narcotized spaciousness (a sensibility reinforced by the mastering treatment of minimalist dub-techno legend Stefan Betke of ~scape/Pole). The gauzy, quavering, reverberant slowcore vibes of artists like Galaxie 500, Grouper and Codeine are a key reference point for Deadbeat & Camara’s prevailing aesthetic: clouds of textured drone and hushed vocals drift through cavernous space, where long decays gently warp and distort the melodic vocal lines and the insistently languid percussion, anchored by thick saturated bass tones representing the most overt influence carried through from their electronic music bona fides. Trinity Thirty is a gorgeously sedate, subtly avant-garde and wonderfully reverent re- interpretation of this classic album.” less"

   "name": "Laurel Halo lands on Latency with a cinematic suite featuring Oliver Coates on cello and drums by Eli Keszler. Making her first move since 2017’s remarkable ‘Dust’ album, Laurel takes inspiration from her score work for Metahaven and Ursula Le Guin’s translation of the ‘Tao Te Ching’ in pursuit of a quieter, more tactile and elusive sound, moving deeper into a sort of twilight avant jazz realm that calls to mind the recently uncovered Luc Ferrari salvo on Alga Marghen as much as flashes of Conlon Nancarrow and the diaphanous swirl of Wolfgang Voigt’s Gas. It's immediately obvious that this is a special release in Laurel’s catalogue. Two 10 minute works bookend the release; the sublime title track with its oneiric mesh of woodwind, early electronic music gestures, and almost funeral organ; and at the opposite end, a stunning symphonic piece that unmistakably recalls Gas, but also unlocks that sound’s potential from the grid thanks to Keszler’s free meter and an embrace of kaotic harmony deeply rooted in Derrick May and Carl Craig’s Detroit classics. But that’s not to discount the bits in between; they’re also brilliant. From her pairing of Keszler’s inimitable snare rushes with dark blue keys and smudged, plasmic electronics in ‘Mercury’, to something like Mark Fell commanding an underwater gamelan orchestra in ‘Quietude’, and the rapid flux of keys in ‘The Sick Mind’, this one has us rapt from every angle. Unmissable! less"

They’re gurningly dissonant, dense and roiling things that resemble aspects of the obscure and classic film soundtracks Thrower is so fond of, drifting from the expansive horrors of ‘For The Dark Planets’ to something like a Carpenter-esque theme for drug-fuelled, noirish stalker scenes, before switching modes again to a sound recalling earlier Alex Zhang Hungtai records, thanks to Thrower’s pealing blue sax in ‘Stems of the Shadowmind’, and ‘A Gulp of Moss, a Breath of Stone’ most beautifully, frightfully limns parallel ambient dimensions in darkly seductive yet elusive detail. less"

Reiko Kudo first debuted on the Tokyo underground music scene in 1980 with Noise, a duo which apart from herself under her then maiden name Reiko Omura on voice, guitar, and trumpet featured Tori Kudo (Maher Shalal Hash Baz) on organ. Like other pioneering female producers from Japan such as Non (of Non Band), Phew, and Haco, Reiko Kudo has an incredibly unique, uncategorizable, and daring voice. Rice Field Slowly Riping In The Night was Reiko Kudo's second album under her own name. It features Tori Kudo as well as Saya and Takashi Ueno (Tenniscoats) on various instruments. The recordings took place in 2000 at Reiko and Tori's house in the rural surroundings of Shikoku Island. All recorded music on this album sounds like it originates in a parallel dimension where time and key signatures simply don't exist. There is nothing accidental or forced here, this is simply music created in a very different way. Restoration and mastering by Detlef Funder at Paraschall Mastering, Düsseldorf; Cut at Calyx, Berlin Translation by Miki Yui and Claus Laufenburg. Includes insert and download; Edition of 400. \"After producing the album Souvenir De Mauve with Maher Shalal Hash Baz which we released on our label Majikick, the idea came to us, to release Reiko Kudo's work. For Reiko's work, we brought our recording equipment from Tokyo to Shikoku and recorded the entire album at her house . . . Reiko plays only at certain times of the day, so that we were able to complete only two or three recordings a day. Therefore, we had plenty of free time. We went to a hot spring, to a cafe, or we tried pottery on a spinning wheel at Tori's workshop. It was a very rewarding time. When this album was finished, we brought it to her to listen to. She said happily 'I think this is the best work I have ever done.'\" --Saya and Ueno (Tenniscoats), Tokyo, 2018 less"

   "name": "Planet Mu’s first footwork signing, DJ Nate boomerangs back to the label nearly a decade since his debut EP and album triggered a rush of interest in the hyper Chicago style. After Nate’s tracks first cropped up on a Dissensus forum thread at the end of the ‘00s, Planet Mu were quickest to his Myspace page, signing what would be most people’s first introduction the evolution of Juke music into its concatenated, battlefloor-ready cousin. The pivotal ‘Bangs & Works’ compilation followed, and with it amazing releases from Jlin, DJ Rashad and Traxman et al, but we’ve basically all got DJ Nate to thank for kick-starting a wider interest in the hyperlocal Chi-town scene. Since then, DJ Nate has focussed on producing R&B and hip hop, finding a strong local following and even an underground hit outside the Chi with ‘Gucci Goggles’, but two years ago he was paralysed from the neck down in an accident from which he only just recovered. But he never forgot about the footwork. ‘Take Off Mode’ collects 17 of Nate’s footwork tracks produced over the interim, including many previously uploaded to YouTube. They’re not quite as frenetic as Nate’s early style, but they’ve still got that sweet, almost feminine sort of pressure intact, making gripping use of pitched (up + down), syrupy R&B and soul samples and his own vocal idents woven into mercurial rhythms and palpitating bass. less"

   "name": "Venerable composer and pianist Charlemagne Palestine revisits his seminal 1976 work ‘The Golden Mean’ in duo with enigmatic artist Rrose, reprising a dialogue started 10 years ago when Rrose was studying at Mills college and looking for a score to Charlemagne’s amazing ‘Strumming Music’… “In 2018 the Festival Variations in Nantes commissions Palestine to perform The Golden Mean, reworking the piece for two pianists. Palestine chose Rrose to join him in this new rendition of the work. Together, they performed The Golden Mean (reborn as “The Goldennn Meeenn + Sheeenn”) onstage at the main opera house in Nantes -- the sumptuous Théâtre Graslin – with extraordinary results. The concept of the ‘golden mean’ goes back to the roots of mathematics, and ancient Greek philosophy. It is an important work in the Palestine mythos, embodying his total immersion in the power of the interval. “It’s probably his most systematic work . . . a step-by-step journey through the intervals of the octave,” says Rrose. “When we rehearsed it, we were noticing how each interval is like a universe of its own -- with its own history, emotions, and sonic qualities all mixed up together. Every time you move from one interval to the next, it feels like moving into another world.” “I love the interval,” Palestine told me in a recent interview. “I love when it plays with itself. That's what I learned from organ musics too. You can just do an interval, and if they're just slightly out of tune with each other, then they shimmer . . . they play themselves. And it sounds like somebody's playing lots of notes. In your ear, it's like an aural phenomenon . . . that's my whole concept. I make something that then does itself somehow. It continues by itself. So I don't have to always be there. And that makes my music a little less egocentric. So there’s more space. Also for the listener — the ear plays with these things, and you're not always being given orders. Your ear isn't given orders all the time of what to listen for.” Beautifully recorded, with mastering by Rashad Becker of Dubplates and Mastering, The Goldenn Meeenn + Sheeenn feels expansive, radiant and hypnotic, opening new ears to its enduring mystery. Rrose adds this note to listeners: “Do not focus your attention on the notes being played, but on the ocean of overtones swimming, suspended, overhead, brushing against one another, kissing one another, melting into one another.” less"

   "name": "Amazing CD volume of unreleased work by Martin Bartlett; a British emigre based in Canada for most of his life, where he established Vancouver’s first Gamelan orchestra, and cultivated a singularly beautiful, even prescient style of electronic composition that worked within, around, and against its conventions and restrictions. This CD containing four durational works, is more sprawling than its sibling LP, running raga seemingly play on electronic bagpipes, thru to vast generative noise tracts, and grand orchestral composition somewhere between Webern and Alice Coltrane. A Real find, especially RIYL Roland Kayn, Pauline Oliveros, David Behrman “Bartlett was a prolific writer, and he expresses himself in fresh, lucid, and wonderfully descriptive prose, offering clear thinking on social aspects of electronic music performance; on the barriers between the performer and the 'black box' and on possibilities for organic systems in electronic music. He also wrote accounts of his sailing trips, treatise on performance practices, and technical academic articles on the systems he built, along with the incandescent manifesto-like piece Electronic Recalcitrant, in which he hoped that electronic music would be imbued with “organic codes of growth and metamorphosis” so that he could “pluck elegant and fleshy electronic sound fish from the frothy algorithmic sea of possibilities”. Key influences were Pauline Oliveros, John Cage and David Tudor, all whom he studied under. Like many of his generation, he became interested in non-Western compositional and philosophical practices, and in 1981 he travelled to India to study Carnatic vocal music with V. Lakshminarayana Iyer in Madras and then on to Burma, Thailand and Indonesia where he studied shadow theatre. He studied South Asian music with Pandit Pran Nath, gamelan with K.R.T. Wasitidipuro, and closely collaborated with Don Buchla on live performances and synthesiser design. He was particularly interested in the Javanese gamelan, which led to him founding the Vancouver Community Gamelan in 1986. On his travels to Indonesia he made hours of field recordings, many of which are accompanied by vivid narrations on the rituals and ceremonies he was documenting. It is unclear why Bartlett’s work remains unknown. Perhaps it is because it remained largely inside the academy. Perhaps his commitment to live performance and community activity means it was more transient than the work of others. Perhaps his openness about his sexuality played a part in his music not receiving much recognition – one can only speculate. But correspondence in his archive shows that rejection and general lack of interest from labels was a source of great personal discontent, leading to Bartlett working again with the Western Front to release his final opus Pythagoras’ Ghost shortly before his death. Bartlett died young, of AIDS-related causes, in 1993, but his music remains a rich source of inspiration, and is characterised by an irresistible and unselfconscious charm that renders his sound unique. These selections, along with the companion LP Anecdotal Electronics, and Luke Fowler’s film Electro-Pythagoras, aim to redress this prior neglect, shedding light on this little known personality from electronic music history, who still has so much to say.” less"

This LP, focussing on Bartlett’s preferred live practice and “other recordings” in 15 parts is a real find, especially if you’ve a penchant for Laurie Spiegel, ÉLG, Todd Dockstader, or David Behrman “Martin Bartlett should be a familiar name. As well as working with a who's who of electronic music, he was an inspiring and original thinker, composer, performer and organiser. His music is distinctive for its warmth and fleshiness, for taking joy from the incidental and anecdotal, and it remains a characterful counterpoint to much contemporary electronic music. It is his preoccupation with building aleatoric elements into electronic music that distinguishes his work, and he devised elegant and open interactions for instrumental performers and computer-controlled synthesizers. This included building his own electronic devices, and extensive work on the Buchla 400. Born in Croydon in 1939, he was adopted as a baby, and later moved with his family to Canada. He did a short stint in the Navy and completed a music degree at the University of British Columbia, studying under Barbara Pentland, before going on to study composition at Mills College in the late 60s. In 1973 Bartlett and seven others founded the Western Front in Vancouver – a cultural cooperative, gallery and performance space that still exists today, housed in the old meeting hall of the Knights of Pythias (a mason-like fraternity). He continued with his research and teaching, and in 1982 was made professor at Simon Fraser University where he remained for the rest of his life. His performances were often collaborative – for the Western Front's second anniversary in 1975 he devised the four-channel piece One Piece for Everyone, a composition where he prepared and cooked a cauliflower curry on a table connected to a synthesizer he had built, while reading from texts on food. When the curry was cooked, the piece ended, and everyone was fed. Bartlett was a prolific writer, and he expresses himself in fresh, lucid, and wonderfully descriptive prose, offering clear thinking on social aspects of electronic music performance; on the barriers between the performer and the 'black box' and on possibilities for organic systems in electronic music. He also wrote accounts of his sailing trips, treatise on performance practices, and technical academic articles on the systems he built, along with the incandescent manifesto-like piece Electronic Recalcitrant, in which he hoped that electronic music would be imbued with “organic codes of growth and metamorphosis” so that he could “pluck elegant and fleshy electronic sound fish from the frothy algorithmic sea of possibilities”.” less"

   "name": "Greg Anderson & Stephen O’Malley’s Sunn 0))) mark 20 years of shaking our foundations with ‘Life Metal’, their 8th studio album and first all analog recording, engineered by none other than Steve Albini. Under a title that pricks trve metal seriousness (it’s an inside joke about Norwegian metal “sellouts”), ‘Life Metal’ is offered as the closest possible representation of the band’s staggering live prowess. Recorded specifically and intensely over a period of just 2 weeks with Steve Albini at Electrical Audio after initial sketches made in LA - contrasting with the 2 year process behind 2009’s ‘Monoliths & Dimensions’ - their intent was to capture the sensation of physically standing in front of their amps whilst they play, aiming to better convey the sensation of being drenched in distorted tonal colour and ravaged by gut rumbling subharmonics. And it’s fair to say they’ve nailed it, like. The sense of resonant space and blistering air throughout the album is viscerally clear and present, but also manifest in a newfound sense of depth to their wall of sound, which is now almost more coral/spongiform, porous to a broader set of world views, energies and influences, yet still unmistakably Sunn 0))). Of course, you’ll need a decent amp and speakers to really feel the lower registers, but this is perhaps one of the first Sunn 0))) albums that’s not so brutally dedicated to the low end. While it’s certainly there, a lot of information is also contained within the mid and even upper ranges of their frequency spectrum, most likely due to the way Albini’s entirely analog signal chain - from mic to tape to vinyl, with no DAT used - truly captures the complexity and shuddering movement of overtones emerging form their claw handed riffs. The appearances of trusted allies such as Hildur Guðnadóttir, who provides eerily absorbing vocals in ‘Between Sleipnir’s Breaths’ and a flooring section on the unruly oddity Haldorophone worthy of comparison with Tony Conrad in closer ‘Novæ’, or Antony Pateras’ pipe organ burning into ’Troubled Air’, also serve vital variables that marble and colour the record, lending an elemental iridescence that highlights the depth of ‘Life Metal’s character. After following these guys for much of their unique artistic trajectory, and paying dues whenever they’re playing live in our city, it’s ever more rewarding to find new subtleties and aspects to Sunn 0)))’s always the same, ever amorphous sound. less"

   "name": "This album is incredible - a highly complex but beautifully fluid traversal of Iranian folk music and modular synthesis that reminds us of Dariush Dolat-Shahi’s unparalleled ‘Electronic Music, Tar and Sehtar’ with its fantastically creative sense of freedom and abstract expression, pulling us deep into uncanny valleys of hyper modernism bursting with ideas and a sense of disrupted harmony that’s hard to absorb in one sitting. One of the most original, multi-layered things we’ve heard this year - a huge recommendation. Ata Ebtekar’s restlessly searching sound has been in action for 30 years now and first appeared on our radar two decades ago with his debut 12” for Warp. Over the years he’s released on half a dozen labels - with Morphine, Sub Rosa and Opal Tapes among them - but this latest work for Diagonal has hit us like no other. On ‘Parallel Persia’, Ebtekar finds a poetic way of uniting his sounds into a brilliant aural energy that absorbs centuries of tradition before feeding into a new dimension of musical exploration. Triggering a series of beguiling chain reactions that resonate throughout each track with electronic frequencies modulating the acoustic and vice-versa, Sote gradually re-sets templates to take us through a wormhole into an alternate reality, the Parallel Persia of the title. On the opening ‘Modality Transporter’, traditional Tar and Santur lay bare, unbothered by synthesis - but by the end of the track they become gradually transformed into ribboning tendrils of extruded electronics that continue to morph in fascinating ways. On ‘Brass Tacks’ they’re joined by unearthly, treated voices, before being pulled into bittersweet taffy on ‘Atomic Hypocrisy’, and utterly upending our proprioceptions in ‘Trans Force’, and the ancient-futuristic chants and dance rhythms recalling Rashad Becker in ‘Pipe Dreams’, until the whole thing ends in a purely singular language of unique intonation and shatterproof, beatless rhythms on ‘Pseudo Scholastic’. ‘Parallel Persia’ explores a subtle, gradual transformation into the unknown that’s both dizzying and inspirational, a reminder that pushing boundaries and templates works best when those boundaries are fully appreciated and understood. Innovation often births chaos and disruption, but beauty and symmetry, ultimately, prevail. less"

Songs like “For the Sun” were written on the spot there, lyrics and all. The lush ambient pieces “Space Ghost I” and “Space Ghost II” began as Brodsky piano compositions and were later fleshed out by additional instrumentation and Nadler’s inimitable vocals. Nadler and Brodsky also recorded two cover songs for the album — the epic Guns n’ Roses power ballad “Estranged” and Morphine’s beguiling “In Spite of Me.” Since childhood, Nadler had been transfixed by the “Estranged” video where Axl Rose swam with dolphins, and she and Brodsky breathe new life into the song here.

Considered in the platonic ideal of great music, the album finds Laura essentially speaking out loud through her trusted Overbow Violin and Double Recorders, as her music flows with a natural cadence, urgency and intimacy that keeps us rapt with the rustic charm of a master story teller from the sticks. “THE SKY UNTUNED takes as it’s starting point the theory of the music of the spheres, in which the universe is constantly making sound that humans cannot hear. The music is teased out of the land and sky and performed using Cannell’s signature minimalist chamber sounds, utilising extended instrumental techniques of overbowed violin (with deconstructed bass viol bow wrapped around the violin to produce drone and melody), scordatura violin tunings and double recorders (inspired by medieval stone carvings). “It is not the result of one commission but a performance drawn from the ideas that have travelled in my thoughts wherever I’ve been over the past 18 months.

   "name": "Manchester’s Mike O’Neill speaks truth to power on ‘The Binary Order’, a scuzzy raw gob of vitriol produced by Sam Weaver and Danny Saul, leading on from Mike’s cult 2013 cassette for Gnod’s Tesla Tapes Lyrically taking aim at Arts Council/Trust-funded lightweights, capitalist realism, and the precarious insecurity of working class life, and set to a mix of rugged, lo-fi breaks, visceral electronics and textured field recordings, the record draws listeners perhaps uncomfortably close into Mike’s street-level worldview. Across 11 songs he grasps the pissy nettle of modern life on a low wage, oppressed by massive, unanswerable corporations and forced to work around a Tory logic that’s at Victorian levels of patronisation and disregard for social welfare - made all the more acute by the fact he hails from within hollering distance of the original slums and overcrowded housing that influenced Marx and Engels’ philosophy. He’s the articulate inheritor of generations of proud, necessary social resistance, the latest vessel for a spirit that runs from the Peterloo Massacre to Emeline Pankhurst, Mike Leigh and John Cooper Clarke. Most distinctively, purposefully enunciated in Mike’s vowel-stressing Manc accent, the lyrics observe a perpetually gloomy state of affairs with the same poetically rhyming meter, unflinching honesty and conviction that makes his live performances so transfixing. Opening with the rising rage of ‘Bleak Northern Roads’ where he zooms out from street-dealing scenes and increasing food prices, to the politics of whit hall, his voice steady but seething, Sam Weaver’s knackered breaks and atonal, slimy electronics bitterly underline the sentiment, using samples of archaic Monarchistic announcements to punctuate the fury leading into cranky highlights such as the hardcore ’89 style UK hip hop of ‘Breakneck Pace’ and ‘Cultural Capital’ - think The Criminal Minds before they went fast - while he excels at a form of modern folk reality in the narration and inclement, skeletal sonic scenery of ‘Modern Industry’, and the pranged dancehall noise torque and warning barbs of ‘Citizen 107’. This is not some trendy virtue signalling or detached do-gooder speaking for others, but the anxious, impending everyday reality of Mike’s life and the communities around him. In ‘The Binary Order’ Mike necessarily sees things in stark monochrome - matters right now are glaringly black and white - but the way the production’s lighting and texture highlights subtleties with flickers of One-Stop neon lend it to comparison with the washed out feel of Mike Leigh’s ‘Naked’, and, just like David Thewlis’ Johnny, Mike tells it how it is. less"

   "name": "Joachim Nordwall aka The iDEALIST gets right inside the echoplex in ‘Early Tactical Experiments’ for the Industrial Coast label. In line with Nordwall's recent run of dubwize material, including a killer 7” and the charred dub pressure underlining the Joachim Nordwall album of collaborations ‘Communication Is The Key’, his ‘Early Tactical Experiments’ are still rudely stripped down and brutish, but also now more technoid and lithe. Whether placing listeners in a ricocheting matrix of splayed drums and bass (‘A Hopeful Dub’), testing out longer-form dub-techno structures (‘The Lowest Form of Your Mind’ + ‘Fire In The Mind’), getting gunky and loose (‘Dub On Arrival’), or pushing dub to its logical limits (‘Zoned Out Deep Zone Son’), he just can't help but apply his taste for extreme, disruptive, or hallucinogenic sounds and forms throughout the album, and that’s one of the big things we love most about his music. less"

   "name": "Master of screwed dub and altered ephemera, Black Zone Myth Chant acts as a dark interpreter for chemical elves on the sunless psychedelia of ‘Voyage Sacrifice’ for Félicia Atkinson & Bartolemé Sanson’s faultless Shelter Press label, under the slightly altered Black Zone Magick Chant alias. It's a whirlpool of fugged-out hallucinations and severely down-pitched vocals with an altered, kaleidoscopic quality - for our money the project's finest hour, residing somewhere between Popol Vuh, Hype Williams, and the knackered smudge of Andy Stott’s classic 'We Stay Together'. Temporarily sacrificing his consciousness for the good of your trip, Maxime Primault aka BZMC has now somehow realised some of the most phantasmagoric sounds in his entire catalogue, which now stretches back over ten years and includes notable highlights in his psych drone project as High Wolf, and pulsing rhythmic noise as Iibiis Rooge. Gutting out his screwed hip hop and dancehall inspirations over three durational parts embracing pitch black, miasmic abstraction, perceptions of time and rhythm become dissolved in the process, aided by a severely down-pitched vocal growl that absorbs the listener into its tantric pacing on ‘Lightless Mountain’, holding the senses under as deathly bells peal for someone or something, and scattered metronomes occasionally accentuate the temporal smudge, spilling over into the seasick brownian slosh of ‘Incineration of Thoughts’. Occasionally a rusted, lurching metronome emerges, infusing a drugged sense of forward motion, but the essence of 'Voyage Sacrifice' is textural and tantric. The specter of dub still looms in the disorienting fog of FX and negative space, but ultimately these sides exist outside (and deep beneath) any recognisable sonic lineage. Like the potential of any trip worth the effort, however, the darkness and the sublime become entwined in the 22 minute counterbalance of ‘Where will we meet when our ashes are spread in the wind?’, which, thru its convincing, iridescent detail seems to describe from the inside, rather than speculate, a divine space or spirited beyond as the result of lived experience. Strongly recommended to anyone with a strong urge to zone out. less"

Arriving as the solo follow-up to ‘Rank Sonata’ [Hallow Ground, 2015], and dished up just prior to his part in last year’s ace Potter Natalizia Zen trio side for Ecstatic, 2017’s ‘The Abominable Slowman’ sees Potter time-travel between various IC Studio locations, tying up loose ends and manipulating perceptions of temporality in his lauded style of psychedelic magick. In five parts he explores components of rhythm as a tool for bending perceptions of time. His motorik meters dwell in a paradoxical state of driving forward motion and repetitive stasis, first erupting from dense, buzzsaw noise into swampy, lysergic and acidic psych grind in ‘Not Yeti’, then slowing the tape down to a crawl and opening out, emphasising strange artefacts therein with ‘The Knights Are Drawing In’. ‘Unstable Tennis’ follows with a gnashing flux of percussion and distorted whirligig leads in a viscous whorl, and the contrast of sludgy trample and piquant electronics in ‘Never Underestimate The Power of Nothing’ brilliantly pull mind and body in opposing directions. less"

   "name": "A year has passed since the untimely death of Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. In tribute to an exceptional artist and musical storyteller, Deutsche Grammophon has compiled a two-volume selection of his most important works. This first part - RETROSPECTIVE I includes seven albums featuring Jóhannsson’s earlier works, including his previously unreleased soundtrack to the documentary White Black Boy. \"The phenomenal Jóhann Jóhannsson was, in his own words, “obsessed with the texture of sound”. Together with a serious dose of creative inspiration, that obsession enabled him to distil music into primal forms. He had a gift for bringing together highly complex themes and starkly contrasting musical ideas with both apparent ease and striking emotional directness. The composer died a year ago at the age of just 48. Deutsche Grammophon is now celebrating his legacy with a two-part retrospective project which will encompass all his major works, along with a previously unissued soundtrack album. The first part of this special edition will appear on 26 April and will comprise seven albums and a hardcover book. Born in Reykjavík on 19 September 1969 Jóhann Jóhannsson was involved with music from an early age. As a young man he played in various rock and pop bands and was part of Iceland’s indie scene, before eventually deciding to focus on writing music rather than performing. His debut album, Englabörn, which came out in 2002, reveals that even at that early stage, he was already a master storyteller, a composer who could translate feelings and emotions into powerfully atmospheric soundscapes and compelling musical portraits. Jóhannsson gained international renown for his 2013 score for the film Prisoners – just two years later he won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for the score for The Theory of Everything. A second Oscar nomination followed in 2016 for the thriller Sicario (2015). He went on to write the scores for the science fiction film Arrival and for The Mercy – the latter album was released shortly before his death; further Hollywood projects were in the pipeline. A pioneering figure in the contemporary music scene, Jóhannsson ignored the barriers between classical and electronic music. By fusing together Minimalist elements, traditional forms, symphonic expansiveness and both acoustic and electronic sounds, he created not only hynotically lyrical images, but also an entirely new musical idiom. The selection of early works that have been chosen for Deutsche Grammophon’s RETROSPECTIVE I show Jóhannsson to have been a composer of imagination and versatility in equal measure. The earliest recording is Virðulegu Forsetar (2004), an hour-long elegiac work for eleven-piece brass ensemble, percussion, electronics, organ and piano, recorded in Reykjavík’s Hallgrímskirkja. The soundtrack album Dís features an exceptional array of artists, including members of the bands The Funerals and Singapore Sling, and singer Ragnheiður Gröndal, who all give intensive voice to Jóhannsson’s melancholy narrative. And in the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees – which weaves together orchestral writing with electronic synth sounds in unique style – was written to accompany the animated short Varmints, while The Miners’ Hymns is the audiovisual masterpiece that resulted from a hugely productive collaboration between Jóhannsson and American filmmaker Bill Morrison. The documentary soundtrack Copenhagen Dreams is Jóhannsson’s tribute to the city in which he was living at the time – a moving sound collage for string quartet, clarinet, celesta, keyboard and electronics. As for Free the Mind, it was written to underpin a documentary about the power of meditation, and is evocatively scored for orchestra, piano, percussion and electronics. A special inclusion in this first retrospective volume is Jóhannsson’s score for White Black Boy. Previously unreleased, this is the soundtrack for the Danish documentary of the same name which sensitively tells the story of Shida, a Tanzanian boy with albinism who is taken away from his parents and sent to boarding school, in order to be kept safe from witch doctors who would otherwise target his body parts and blood. This vibrant and revealing musical portrait of Jóhann Jóhannsson is accompanied by a hardcover book containing essays by Wyndham Wallace and John Schaefer and a generous selection of photos of this most modest of artists, providing further insight into his life and work.\" less"

   "name": "First reissue of Ut’s NYC no wave classic ‘Conviction’ since 1987! Newly packaged with liner notes by OG fanboy Stewart Lee Well known as the band who would all swap instruments after every song, Ut are the pioneering trio formed by Jacqui Ham, Nina Canal, and Sally Young during the heyday of “no wave” - a non-sound drawing on everything from noise to disco and jazz, and hellbent on pricking punk’s swell head and the pomp of late ‘70s heavy and prog rock styles. Ut were among the most adept of their wave at ripping it all up and starting from scratch, quite literally doing it between songs, insisting on a reliance on in-the-moment intuition and improvisation in a way that railed against mainstream trends for virtuosity and unwieldy egos. Their ’Conviction’ was recorded in 1985 toward the end of the no wave phase and finds their white hot guitars at their most nerve-jangling and spiky, pushed by clattering drums and possessed vox from the slunky swagger of ‘Confidential’, to open-out in key with their free jazz inspirations on ’Stain’, balmy folk strokes in ‘Bedouin’, and skipping from the reversed tapes loops of ‘Kcahsmahs (Spare Coconut)’, before letting all slosh out without giving a fuck on ‘Mouse Sleep’. less"

   "name": "Faith was released in 1981 and is the second in a trio of albums (starting with Seventeen Seconds and ending with Pornography) that are considered by some the most important and influential in The Cure's discography. Fuelled by Simon Gallup’s Fender bass - in turns deep, angular, growling and comforting - for our money it's one of the most sparse and singular albums to ever edge into the mainstream. The monochromatic cover image (a picture of Bolton Priory in the fog, painted by The Cure’s Porl Thompson) gives away the mood here; funereal, downcast, brooding, containing some of Robert Smith’s most unashamedly morose songs. But it’s the production, influenced by Joy Division, that’s a complete revelation. ‘All Cats Are Grey’, as one example, does a thing with synths, bass and percussion that could effectively have been the blueprint for much of the last 4 decades at the fringes of electronic music. ‘Faith’, the closing, title track, repeats the trick - but this time with a treated drum track so delicate and forward thinking we could listen to it on a loop for eternity. All of this would be for nothing if it wasn’t for Robert Smith’s songwriting - here in fine form on the hooky ‘Primary’ and ‘Doubt’, as well as the foreboding ‘Funeral Party’, but this is The Cure album that is, above all, defined by its sound and production. ’Disintegration’ (which appeared almost a decade later) is far more grand and ambitious in scale and has understandably become the go-to The Cure album for those looking for a depressive fix. But, for us 'Faith' (and to a slightly lesser extent, ‘Seventeen Seconds’), feels like the most conceptually tight and age-defying work in their enviably deep catalogue, and the one whose influence we hear most often at the margins. If you’re interested in bass sounds, and space - so much space - in production, this is basically the template. Perfection. less"

   "name": "Ravishing, dramatic and rambunctious chops from sax virtuoso and Joy O collaborator Ben Vince accompanied by Micachu, Rupert Clervaux, Merlin Nova, Valentina Magaletti and Cam Deas. Definitely one of the strongest WTN? drops in memory. RIYL Diamanda Galas, Chaines, Karl D’Silva, Colin Stetson “‘Assimilation’ dives right in with Vince assuming downtown skronk, perfectly complementing the commanding no-wave theatrical vocal prowess of Merlin Nova. ‘Alive & Ready’ serves as an avant-garde energy blast, launching us into orbit. Ben’s next spatial movement glides towards ‘What I can see’, a collaboration with Mica Levi, here donning her Micachu moniker to deliver her signature downcast experimental pop dexterity across Vince’s beautifully treated sax scape. The results are a moving, considered, crafted piece which undeniably nods towards Arthur Russell’s ‘World of Echo’, encompassing that same timeless, ethereal beauty. Mica and Ben’s moment of longing melancholy is short lived, as we’re shuffled along to ‘Sensory Crossing’, a collaboration with Rupert Clervaux in which he evidences his groundings in Jazz percussion, experimental electronics, and deep interest in ethnomusicology - further exploring and expanding on the basin navigated during his collaborative album with Beatrice Dillon ‘Studies I-XVII for Samplers and Percussion’ to create a blanket of bubbling, wired, frenzied yet fluid motorik groove. Vince’s improvisation here remains restrained throughout, conversing with Rupert’s movements rather than attempting to shadow or overshadow them, an idea which perhaps is cemented in his exclamation that “Collaboration, and also the wider idea of 'communicating' in general, is, for me, assimilating the other, becoming the other, at least temporarily, to forge a point of connection. When we are able to let down our barriers, let ourselves affect and be affected, we can truly communicate.” ‘Tower of Cells’, another percussion led collaboration features drummer Valentina Magaletti (Editions Mego), and sonic explorer Cam Deas (Death of Rave). Magaletti’s immersive, hypnotic, & deep styling holds firm Deas’ synth transmissions & Vince’s wandering, brooding, layered sax drone across 10 minutes of truly refreshing alien Jazz – Think the Necks mixed by Scientist on this one. ‘Assimilation’ rolls us out in fine style with Vince riding solo. Fluttering tonal Sax lines build and build before become interspersed with layers of fourth world styled exotic flurries. Held together by a single perpetual hypnotic bass thud ‘Assimilation’ brings to mind the similarly exotic experimental works of Muslimgauze & Jon Hassell. This final track essentially serves as a space for some reflection, joyously winding down a journey which manages to truly make the ethereal and the intense run alongside each other in perfect harmony.” less"

   "name": "South London grime/drill producer Nammy Wams kicks off Grime Tapes, a physical wing of Slackk’s seminal pirate radio archive, Grimetapes.com, with ‘Yellow Secret Technology’ - a killer 20 track retrospective pulling from Nammy’s archive of hyper-colourful and kinetic productions circa 2013 to 2018 Compiled and sequenced by wise wan, Slackk, ‘Yellow Secret Technology’ is the 1st in a series of releases promised on Grime Tapes, the label, which is founded just over 10 years since the demise of Slackk’s Grimetapes.com. During grime’s golden era in the mid ’00s it was one of very few sites online to share pirate radio recordings beyond their original broadcast range, providing an invaluable service to many appreciative ears and early grime fiends in the UK and abroad. As host of his own weekly Croydon FM show and producer for Marcus Nasty’s Rinse FM slot, Nammy Wams brings that London grime radio connection full circle in ’Yellow Secret Technology’. Under a title that nods to his Vietnamese heritage and A Guy Called Gerald’s classic jungle LP, Nammy’s trax clash the dynamics of early jungle with the Far Eastern-facing melodies of early Jammer, Slew Dem or Hyperdub, plus the weirdo, mutant freakishness of the Boxed lot, whom Nammy has been affiliated with since their inception, and where he started to feed demos to Slackk. Without exception, all 20 tracks of ‘Yellow Secret Technology’ are bangers in their own right, each riddled with nagging hooks and burning emotions, but it’s Slackk’s sequencing that makes the collection such an enjoyable album. Selected from an abundance of material, the final cut expertly highlights myriad shades to Nammy’s style, from the star-eyed pads and wavey flow of ‘Rocks’ at the front to the giddy rude fanfare of ‘Less’ at the back, taking in crushing grime/drill fusions such as ‘Tempest’ and the darkside pressure of ‘Wapper’ alongside ecstatic dancefloor sidewinders in ‘Miharu’ and spine-tracing sweetboy grime of ‘Prayer’. Like we say, there’s a f*ck-tonne of material here - and not a dud among them, effectively serving the fullest testament to Nammy’s faithfully rugged, rude and playful style that any grime fiend could hope for. Moreover, ‘Yellow Secret Technology’ highlights a modest but gifted artist in an appropriate manner, providing physical space and time on the tape to really immerse in Nammy’s sound, and in a way that’s often negated by everything-at-once streaming/scrolling/skipping. It’s a properly ideal listen for late evening headphone commutes, and a neatly nostalgic yet forward survey of where grime has come and gone since the golden days of the Grimetapes era. less"

Arriving four years since the 1st Karamika LP on ESP Institute, ‘2.0’ feels equally dazed and etheric, like the work of inhabitants on a shuttle travelling light years from earth, for whom time has become a relative concept compared to their dying species back on earth. Drawn into their space and pace, we find unnamed voices revolving like obsessive memories in a lonely head on the pulsing reiterations of ‘Ton 2.1’ before slipping into Global Communication-esque celestial isolation on ‘Ton 2.2’, whilst slugging mechanical rhythms chart a path towards the quietly breathtaking sublime of ‘Ton 2.5’, and what sounds like Teresa Winter singing from beyond our solar system in the utterly unmissable highlight of ‘2.6’.

Immaculate strums, daubs of electronics and those gossamer vocals recall everything from Talk Talk to The Durutti Column and Zelionople “Following their meditative self-titled debut and its captivatingly sparse follow-up ‘Mokragora,’ ‘Gallery Love’ achieves what it sets out to do and more, taking the listener on an auditory journey with lucid song structures that ebb and flow like the waves. A sublime musical experience, its hypnotic repetition is an ode to refinement, and the gentle forays into ambient electronica and jazz show impeccable restraint and sensitivity. ‘Gallery Love’s’ opening track and first single ‘Virtual U’ was born from very few elements. A beat on the MPC, a few chords on the Korg Trident and some gently lilting vocal jams create the structure, like a digital collage of feelings as vocalist Xavier Marin describes it. \"I see this song as a hyperobject, an external entity moulding modern relationships, shadowing us. An anti-form creating distance in the closeness. A vast empty space between two islands.” Recorded at his Mother’s house, ‘Best In You’ was the last song written on the record, whilst the mystically poetic ‘Agró Blanc’ is named after a type of heron that dwells in Mallorca. The band describe ‘River of Jasmines’ as the most mysterious track on the record, the lyrics coming to Xavier during a nap in the studio. “I recorded the vocals in one take with no set lyrics, just the lines that came to my mind. I tried a second go but it felt meaningless” he explains. ‘Vernal Pools’ is a funky existentialist piece, a reflection of a landscape in a pond, a contemplative loop, an iconic natural spot. A dubby & aqueous bassline conducts the title album’s title track, it’s ambient sounds featuring traces of kalimba and a field recording of an owl who frequented the house during the night. ‘A Pale Blue Dot’ is a floaty, dream-like jam and ‘Samuel Sings’ is a “calling to a lost soulmate.” The dainty trance of ‘Fountain At the Entrance’ rounds things off in mesmerising fashion.” less"

   "name": "From the top shelf of UK soundsystem culture, Soul Jazz pull up a cracking selection from the Fashion Records archive, running classic Dancehall, Jungle and Lovers Rock from Cutty Ranks to General Levy, Carlton Lewis, Top Cat and Janice Walker Between the early ‘80s and late ‘90s Fashion Records were crucial players in the dialogue between Jamaican, Caribbean music and the sound of UK’s urban centres, and their influence would spill over to become a cornerstone of British dance music culture. “While nearly all other UK reggae labels focused on releasing Jamaican music, from the early days of Island and Trojan in the 1960s, through Island and Virgin in the 1970s and Greensleeves that came up in the 1980s, Fashion’s focus was firmly on music produced in the UK. This unique British perspective shaped both lyrical content and musical fashion. And like all the great music labels, from Studio One to Blue Note, Fashion was able to create a significant roster of its own artists. Amazingly for a small independent label, a number of Fashion artists achieved mainstream UK chart and crossover success, including Laurel & Hardy, Smiley Culture and General Levy. But although this success was welcomed, crossing over into the mainstream was never the main focus for label owners Chris Lane and John McGillivray (who also runs the successful Dub Vendor record shop), whose starting point was always primarily focused on producing quality music first. In the early 1980s, Fashion Records captured the rise of the emerging British dancehall scene in its ascendency. The large roster of first generation British-born artists and MCs on the label, including General Levy, Papa Face, Smiley Culture, Bionic Rhona, Asher Senator, Laurel & Hardy, Top Cat and many more, often gave a unique and sometimes humorous British lyrical perspective to Fashion releases, discussing everyday subjects, from police harassment to road safety. Throughout much of the 1980s and into the 1990s Fashion continued to release an almost relentless array of UK dancehall releases as well as continuing with lovers rock and the occasional dub releases. Then, in the mid-90s, with the dancehall and reggae releases still coming on strong, Fashion released a superb series of early jungle tracks linking Jamaican and British MCs and dancehall artists with young jungle mixers, remixers and producers. By this time dancehall artists General Levy and Cutty Ranks had become the staple vocal samples of literally hundreds of white label jungle records and Fashion took advantage of this, often getting young producers to work in exchange for sample clearances. This album is a subjective and scatter-gun ride through some of the many unique and heavyweight tracks to come out of the Fashion stable - some classics, some lesser-known, all 100% killer.” less"

   "name": "New music ensemble Eye Music interpret ‘Sapporo’, a seminal, minimalist, graphic score by Toshi Ichiyanagi - the elder statesman of Japanese avant-garde composition, who was famously married to Yoko Ono during the late ‘50s ‘Sapporo’ is considered a classic of the ‘60s trend towards graphic notation, which emerged in the wake of Webernian serialism, and from the intersection of west and eastern musical philosophies catalysed by John Cage, as a way of freeing up music in key with the social, sexual, economic and political revolutions of that important post-WWII era. The piece requires each performer - in this case Eye Music’s 11-piece ensemble employing everything from analog synths to psaltery bow and umeboshi pit, and kitchen faucets - to play from one page of graphic notation, with each performer aleatorically synching at some point in the piece, but hardly ever at the same points in any two performances. In effect it’s totally open-ended, with no fixed start or finish point, with this 2006 recording going to just over 50 minutes, whereas previous iterations have lasted only 15 minutes. According to the score’s long, straight lines denoting sustained tones, angular lines describing glissando, and dashes calling for short sounds, the piece if played at slower paces, naturally opens out to reveal long pauses amid its naturally gentle topography, where plateaus intersect sliding descents and elide with inclines and a range of punctuating ephemera, recalling the graceful logic of a Japanese garden turning from dusk to night. less"

   "name": "Minimalist german vocalist Marianne Schuppe breaks down the definition of a “song” on ‘Nosongs’, her super sparse follow-up to 2015’s ‘Slow Songs’, further distilling/reducing that album’s themes for the estimable Edition Wandelweiser Records Accompanying herself with lute and uber-bows in 11 ‘Nosongs’, Marianne vacillates english and german language in phrases that linger on the air, leaving lots of tenebrous silence and space to the imagination in a way that becomes just as crucial as the tangible sounds to the album’s hypnotic yet barely there pull. Like probably at least a few others, we’re left wondering wtf are Uber Bows (Google’s providing no help), but that’s also the most trivial mystery about ‘Nosongs’, whose enigmatic appeal is genuinely timeless, bringing the age old craft of a bard or singer of myriad stripes, right down to their essence. Like any folky worth their Arran sweater collection, she has the transfixing quality of a singer who can silence a barn or room and draw the audience deep into her own world. But this really isn’t folk music, and what she’s doing appears to defuse more lofty avant-garde vocal music and bring it down to a plaintiveness that also implies some calm, religious, and devotional connotations, although they aren’t really there either. What we’re left with feels like a cycle of songs seemingly shorn of sentimentality, yet remaining beautiful in a relatively popular sense, with only precisely chosen words and the subtlest of instrumental gestures that, through her precise enunciation and slow, careful cadence, maybe speak volumes more than artists who simply let it all out, which is nonetheless a valid approach. In other words, she’s doing for vocal music what Morton Feldman and Giacinto Scelsi have for instrumental piano music. less"

There appears to be no prior mention of the release or artist on the internet and quite how it came into of Offen Music possession is not disclosed, and that only ratchets the record’s enigma to astonishing degrees once you’ve heard the music. In a quivering, high register, androgynous trill, Ihor Tsymbrovsky beckons heavenly beings in the remarkable A-side Come, Angel against a swirling backdrop of phasing, subtly delayed organ. It was recorded in one take (this is the 2nd version), and, if we’re not mistaken, you can hear the keys being pressed rhythmically in the background, which seems to be the song’s only tangible connection to this mortal world as Ihor vaults octaves high and close-in-the-mix with the sort of alien, dreamlike vocal that require pinching oneself to make sure you’re awake. Spellbinding is definitely the word. On the other side he (we’re assured it is a ‘he’ in the promo text) sets two poems by Mykola Vorobyov and Mykhal Semenko, respectively, to emphatic piano keys, this time more shy of FX save for some delay, placing that willowing, avian vocal at a dreamy arms reach in Roses for the Poet, and with a sort of liturgical dark jazz feel, sorta like Lewis repenting his sins as a castrato monk, in the spare atmosphere in By the Sea.

   "name": "Efdemin discovers his folk-techno voice on ‘New Atlantis’, with results not dissimilar to a Richard Youngs experiment, or indeed, Efdemins’s recent collaboration with Oren Ambarchi and Konrad Sprenger, who also appears inside. “Over eight tracks, New Atlantis oscillates between fast, kaleidoscopic techno, multilayered drones and acoustic instrumentation, fusing for the first time Sollmann’s deep dancefloor productions as Efdemin with his sound art and experimental music projects. The latter include 2017’s Harry Partch- inspired Monophonie performance and 2018’s Panama / Suez EP with Oren Ambarchi and Konrad Sprenger. Long drawn to utopian musical traditions, Sollmann took inspiration for New Atlantis from Francis Bacon’s unfinished 17th century novel of the same name, which describes a fictional island devoted to social progress through the synthesis of art, science, technology and fashion. In the story, Bacon imagines futuristic ‘sound houses’, which contain musical instruments capable of recreating the entirety of the sounds of the universe; a 400-year-old prophesy of today’s digital sonic reality. Through Sollmann’s lens, Bacon’s vision ebbs and flows over 50 minutes in varying speeds and colors, emerging as a tapestry of different utopian musical traditions – through billowing synth lines, early Detroit techno, resonant wooden percussion, trance, droning organs, dulcimer, electric guitars, hurdy-gurdy, just intonation, poetry, hymns and murmuring voices.” less"

   "name": "Recital at their very best here with an unmissably gorgeous 1st vinyl issue of music by Rip Hayman; - a pioneering forerunner of ambient music, and pivotal member of NYC’s downtown music community since the ‘70s, beloved for his holistic embrace of sound in its myriad forms Working at the point where avant ambient imagination meets the raw beauty of nature, ‘Dreams of India and China’ is a collage of Rip Hayman’s archival field recordings and hard-to-find tape releases dreamily layered and sequenced by Recital boss Sean McCann. Overseen in production by Hayman and his longtime foil Charlie Morrow (himself a subject of previous Recitals), the results speak to a sublime, un/consciously utopian conception of sound as environmental, borderless and timeless, and most of all a rich source of happiness and pleasure. From an itinerant family background in the military which took him to all corners of the globe, it was the music and philosophy of India and far East Asia which really prompted Hayman to make music. He joined Columbia University in the late ‘60s but was soon put off by the restrictions of Serialism, favouring to solder electronics and make music at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Centre. Then the Fluxus movement hit, radically expanding the notion of what is art, leading him to the downtown lofts and galleries alongside John Cage, Phil Corner, Petr Kotik, Yoshi Wada, and in 1975 he set up both EAR magazine, and the EAR bar, which would host early performances by Arthur Russell, Peter Zummo and even Queen Latifah. Immersed in the truly avant culture of the NYC in the ‘70s, Hayman’s own music understandably formed its own, wide-reaching logic, incorporating performance, events, and deep listening with a “tangible spirit based on the awareness of sound, mingling meditation, mystery, humor, and human response.” In Sean McCann’s sensitive layered collage of Hayman’s recordings, we hear his intentions clearly manifest in dreamlike form, drifting from recording of Indian nose flute and Tibetan monk thigh bone trumpet, to snatches Bach’s Goldberg Variations played at half speed during his Dreamsound events for sleeping audiences, and his Bell Roll performance - rolling down a hill wearing a suit of bells - together with intoxicating field recordings of the Ganges and temple drums in Rajasthan. Quite simply ‘Dreams of India and China’ is one of the most enchanting records we’ve heard in some time, a slab that bears many repeat listens, where listeners will discover new layers and life with each return. It’s hugely recommended. less"

The artist really uses the sound as dense blocks to be intersected, conjuring an anxious state that makes us feel as though on a collision course between massive objects in low visibility... “French sound artist Félix Blume keeps pushing the boundaries of field recordings for our enjoyment. “Fog Horns” captures the sounds of boat horns in Piraeus, Athens, Greece, the port city that serves some of the most important ferry routes in Greece nowadays. Yes, boat horns are annoying, sometimes disturbing and even absurdly disrupting if you live in a port city or one that is blessed with the arrival of cruises. We all know that. But we also knew that recordings of funerals could be tricky, and Félix Blume pulled a gem out of last year’s “Death In Haiti - Funeral Brass Band & Sounds Of Port Au Prince (CREP51)”. And he has done it again. The A side reveals a long track recorded during a fog horn concert whilst side B features three 'remixes' of the same recordings, paying respect to what Ingram Marshall did in “Fog Tropes” in three different 'movements'. In a way, B side sounds like the perfect soundtrack for the recent remake of “Suspiria”. But Thom Yorke got in the way. Jokes aside, there’s something magical about these horns. In the eighteen minutes of the first side, Félix Blume explores the concept of a concert played by those horns. The horns dominate but sounds of the surroundings create a perfect balance to the drone hysteria. The surrounding sounds are the heartbeat of this track. The horns are the metal section of an orchestra, while the rest works like the strings. Hidden melodies are revealed when you listen to this with your full attention, and the more you do it, the horns become less present, vivid. It’s one of the many crafts of Félix Blume, the more you live with his music, the more you focus outside the plot. If those eighteen minutes sound tremendously real, the three tracks on the other side feel like a horror film. The warmth disappears to become cold ambiance, beautifully textured and enigmatic sounds take over. Horns are still heard, but they’re a different kind of horns. It seems that Félix Blume is playing with our perception, from bliss to horror. A honk will never be the same again.” less"

Stresses of the city were replaced by the fall and rise of the North Sea and endless salt flats. Sounds from the environment filtered in and I would stop often to record what I was hearing around me.” Back home in London, the hours of amassed field recordings would form the backbone and inspiration for a whole album worth of outpourings from John’s six-years-in-the-making modular synth. From the evocative sound of sea birds on Pillar and Stepper Motor to the colourful conversation from a country pub in This Way Out, the apposite selection of samples which made the final edit provide the perfect jumping-off point for John’s synths to soar with abandon, at times uplifting, frenetic, haunting, hypnotic or meditative, but always atmospheric and with unstoppable propulsion. “Above all else, I wanted the album to exude a sense of constant forward motion but at a very human scale,” says John. Thus drummer friends Tom Skinner (Hello Skinny) and Sebastian Rochford (long-time collaborator in the twice Mercury Prize-nominated band Polar Bear) were roped in to lend their suitably clattering human momentum, on Doing The Beeston Bump and Dunes respectively. Working in tempos to match his walking speed throughout - “whether trudging along a rainy shingle beach or running up wildflowering clifftop paths” - Yes!

Riobamba, Florentino… Premo French producer and beat maker for Bad Gyal’s Spanish reggaeton hit ‘Fiebre’, King Doudou answers his call up to the crack squad at Low Jack’s Les Disques De La Bretagne in heavy style, doing gully drill with Baile Funk innovator MC Buseta and yung gun Kaydy Cain on ‘Novinha’, alongside the darker dembow knuck of ‘Tremendo Bumbum’, both replete with grade A instrumentals. Over the past 10 years Doudou has been a central node of globalised bass music in France and Catalonia, delivering heat for everyone from Mad Decent and Mixpak to ZZK and Sound Pellegrino. For Editions Gravats’ unruly sister label, Doudou bowls a proper sidewinder with the whipsmart drill vamps and steel-fanged snares of ‘Novinha’ capped by the icy delivery of Kaydy Cain and MC Buseta’s mumbling inflection, while the B-side’s ‘Tremendo Bumbum’ comes looser, wild-eyed with restless reggaeton torque tempered by Buseta’s monotone, paso-doble chat.

The first cut is a proper ripper featuring both in a dual to unpick the maddest variety of fractured sounds in rapid flux, before they gel in grittier, viscous roil on ‘Nacre’ only to erupt with destructive noise force,and resolve with the melodic whirligig of ‘Superbad’.

On this new album she hands co-production over to PAN-affiliate Steven Warwick aka Heatsick, Gang of Ducks’ Alessio Capovilla, Mark Davies alias The Pylon King and the late Steve Moshier, who produced the original Breadwoman tape. In opener ‘O’sa Va’ya’, Capovilla buoys Anna’s starkly impassioned cry with floating organ passages to utterly transportive effect, a kind of detached mirror image of This Mortal Coil / Liz Fraser’s take on 'Song To The Siren’, while Steven Warwick lends a more retro-futuristic melody to ‘Nepenthe’, named after the ancient Greek drug of forgetfulness, but ironically working as the most memorable piece on the album, framing Homler against a divine choir of herself and undulating, iridescent arps. Steve Moshier appears posthumously on the album’s standout title track, underlining Homler's prelinguistic vocal with 15 minutes of whirling ambient passages that do much to highlight her instinct for inescapably formless shapes; a genuinely alien, multi-faceted and uncompromising exercise in sound art that we still can’t fully get the measure of several listens later. less"

   "name": "Lieven Martens (Dolphins Into The Future) proves an ideal candidate for Longform Editions with ‘Deo Gratias Triginta Sex’, a 30 minute work of processed choral polyphony, turning 18 singers into an orgy of harmonics and writhing, withering rhythms with stop-in-your-tracks effect “Johannes Ockeghem (1410 – 1497), born in Saint Gislain - Hainaut, Belgium - and for a while living in Antwerp, wrote one of our nation’s greatest hits. Deo Gratias is a canon for 36 singers and apparently he wrote this particular song as kind of a joke or game; quickly “between the soup and the potatoes” as we would say in Dutch. Some say Ockeghem had in mind that a much larger number of people should perform this piece, but it was considered too complicated to find enough experienced singers, to make the piece correct measure-wise, et al. Let’s open Logic X Pro and try and see if we could help Ockeghem to make this vision a (simulated…) reality. Since this is a creation for deep and / or extended listening I selected a sligthly longer version of the song rendered by Paul Van Nevel and the Huelgas Ensemble, and layered and sequenced this 36 times in row. Every new sequence starts more or less according to Ockeghem’s original transcript. Small detail… in the version of the Huelgas Ensemble no more than 18 voices are singing contemporarily. As soon as the first voice of the fourth (bass) chorus reaches its final note every voice \"freezes\" at its current line in melody… The layering of these sounds in the computer let the overtones shine and the human breathing and whistling create pretty rhytmic parents. The project shows that Ockeghems original idea is kinda genious since however you layer this music, the final result, be it a bit dense and somewhat conjested drone, is still very harmonic. Inspiring. At first i started cutting, trimming and pitch correcting parts, making the piece a more correct rendition of the original four canon idea. But then i realized that the best manner to execute this version is to keep it simple and short, between the forementioned “soup and potatoes”. So here goes with all the gentle flaws… At certain points you hear 11 times the same part overlaid. Thus 11 x 18 singers = 198 singers! Here’s to making Ockeghem’s grand vision come to (a simulated…) life.” less"

   "name": "Longform Editions coax out a magnificent, hour-long ambient banner from Robert Cox’s revitalised Rimarimba project. Ideal for taking a stroll and letting your head unravel “I live on the coast. The inspiration came from daily walks by the sea. The background ever changing drone is the restless sea, the cellos are the breaking waves, their 'gritty' sound quality is the pebbles washing back down the beach and the higher pitched twiddly things are the circling sea gulls. Although 'real' waves have a frequency of 7–8 per minute and, yes, approximately the seventh one is often the biggest I have slowed mine down as they sounded too fast at 7–8/m. Think of these as long Pacific rollers breaking on a distant shore. Unlike most of my compositions this one has no percussion. The whole beast was made from acoustic and electric guitar parts recorded onto a Tascam DP32. Many had their initial attack removed and some were looped on an Electro-Harmonix 45000 looper. The 'strings' were produced by feeding some parts through an Electro-Harmonix Mellotron pedal. A Yamaha SPX 2000 processed many of the parts in various unspeakable ways until they 'felt' about right. A Lexicon Reverb worked its magic as only Lexicon can. About half of the parts play in reverse at various points. The guitars used were a Furch SJV 121 Lux acoustic 12 string, hand made in the Czech Republic in 1997, and a Gibson ES335 electric, made in Nashville, USA in 1987. Both were tuned in open C – CGCGCE. This is an age of ever shortening attention spans driven by the constructs of our online world. News is delivered as headlines to skim across with little in the way of in depth explanation or examination. The so called 'long read' pieces in online news sites are no more than the first two columns of a four page article in the Sunday newspapers from a few years ago. Ebooks do not convey the same experience as print on paper. Without the physical presence and weight of a book digital information can feel as ephemeral as television advertising. Wikipedia, good though it is, does not allow for the chance discoveries that come from turning the page in a reference book or encyclopedia. Saving a link in order to return to an online article is not the same as remembering the piece about electrons is about one third of the way through the volume E–G a few pages after the picture of the Egyptian statue. Whilst static art is still, well, static and you can gaze upon and contemplate a painting or a sculpture for as long as time permits how many do so when we are conditioned by the predominance of moving images. Slow cooking is a healthy reaction to fast, commercialised, food. Likewise both walking and cycling (slow travel) rather than driving make for a deeper experience of the journey. A long piece of music be it a symphony, an ambient work or a jazz suite creates a mindscape in which the listener can lose and find themselves as their attention wanders and returns. It can trigger a memory in that moment at 37 minutes which is different the next time they hear it because they almost inevitably arrive at that moment having taken a different path through the piece. Today the bass line, tomorrow the percussion figures, the day after the unfolding harmonies. This takes time to achieve, time that is not available in a three minute pop song. The listener who allocates enough of their time will find an hour immersed in a piece of music is at least as beneficial as a long soak in a warm bath.” less"

You can just about make out those lost voices roaming around the pulverised mix of 'Stained Glass Body' and the billowing 'River Like Spine’ - though it's impossible to make any single element out given how melted and fluid the mixing is, bringing a frail human element to an album that otherwise sounds entirely not of this Earth.

Electing to use their own names, ’Loyalty Does Not End With Death’ is the final part of a spoken word trilogy initiated in 1990 with the Psychick TV & White Stains side ’At Stockholm’, and proceeded by their ‘Wordship’ [2004] album as Thee Majesty & Cotton Ferox, and is the first appearance the pair have had together on vinyl. It’s the sound of two cosmically-travelled minds crossing paths again after a long absence in which they’ve been able to chew over the bare essentials - love and magick - via vibrant poetry and beautifully charged forms of ambient music. In nine parts they conjure a warmly meditative space, where Abrahamsson’s characteristic tones, cut-up electronics and gentle rhythms comfortably lay the bed for Genesis, who inhabits and enlivens the pristine scenes like an observant dark interpreter, translating the incomprehensible and revealing the divine through their psychedelic prism. The spellbinding results were recorded in New York and Stockholm 2017/18 and could feasibly have occurred at any point between 1990 and now. They are blessed with a pacing, intuition and timelessness that pays testament to an enduring creative friendship, taking the form of writing, interviews, photographs and film for nearly 35 years, bringing to resolution an almost life-long arc. less"

The results are absolutely choice examples of that era, ranging from tuff but deep breakbeats to dead sexy proto-Goa styles including the lusting ‘Sexafari’ and languorous classic ‘Trance Fusion’, as recently hailed by Hunee and also reissued in the ‘Antwerp Bio Techno 1989-94’ EP. So yeh, a favourite of ours for a good few years now, ‘Musaics’ is a little world unto itself, folding in all stripes of environmental sounds, acidic synths and lithe rhythms to terraform a psychedelic rave dream just prior to it all tipping into “hardcore”. As they state int he liner notes, the duo arrived art this style serendipitously via simply mixing two records together with a mixer. That might sound easy and obvious, but remember this was the start of Europeans pissing around on two turntables, finding that mythical 3rd track, and attempting to recreate its imaginary clash of textures, tones and grooves. Like UK producers who were also applying the same Hip Hop-based ideas with a twisted lip and at faster tempos, Mappa Mundi did it slower, psychedelic, but still with a rugged appeal. It’s there everywhere from the very Bristolian parallels of opener ‘Urbi Et Mori’ with its depth charge subs, to the aforementioned beauty ‘Sexafari’ and its writhing 808s, to the mix of didgeridoo and rap knocks in ‘Serendipity (Take 1)’, and thru to full swing break in ‘The Oracle’ or the New Jack Swang of ‘Wölfli’, but hardly better than on ‘Trance Fusion’, one of the sexiest, enchating 11 minutes of slow dance music produced in 1990.

During the post-independence climate of the 1960s, Presidents Sukarno and Suharto encouraged artists to renew and innovate traditional Indonesian art forms in an attempt to limit and control the spread of Western music - which was banned from broadcasting in 1961. This policy saw a revival of traditional musical styles like gamelan degung, and the emergence of Indonesian singing genres: jaipong and pop sunda.

   "name": "Mutant R&B starlet Lafawndah places her vocals front and centre over bashy, technoid backdrops produced by Aaron David Ross (Gatekeeper/ADR) and others on her debut album ‘Ancestor Boy’, following up her recent link-up with Midori Takada. “The debut full- length album from Lafawndah, ANCESTOR BOY, released via her own label imprint CONCORDIA, is a bracing statement of intent, heralding an artist unbound in scope, scale, and intensity. She opens 2019 with bold single DADDY, plotting new territory onto her own highly personalized map of influence – a map drawing the club, composition, and pop into thrillingly unresolved, ultramodern erotics. Lafawndah’s 2018 was filled with myriad musical highlights and successes - including a celebrated performance featuring peers Tirzah, Kelsey Lu and more at London’s South Bank in December, growing from her acclaimed HONEY COLONY mixtapes. Meanwhile her heart-stopping inter-generational music &amp; film collaboration with japanese ambient legend Midori Takada in Le Renard Bleu (with KENZO and Partel Oliva) continues to echo into new forms, with a full production performance titled ‘Ceremonial Blue’ premiering at the Barbican, London in April. And streaming now, her achingly beautiful self-directed video for JOSEPH - a lullaby and an ode to newborn life co-written with Jamie Woon and also featuring on ANCESTOR BOY - has set Lafawndah apart as an independent director with a singular vision spanning multiple media and artforms. Having in her prior self-titled and TAN EPs upturned geography, in ANCESTOR BOY Lafawndah digs deep to unravel geology, mining emotions of the deep past and future. The album’s physicality is elemental; its memory, mineral. It is a becoming- of- age story for a people yet to come, created out of a need to find the others. In the middle of the album’s sonic and lyrical onslaught is the desire to share the uncertainties of growing up when you don’t belong anywhere. Crafted with the aid of fellow travelers Nick Weiss, Aaron David Ross, and James Connolly, ANCESTOR BOY’s maximalism- it’s overflow of detail, of feeling, of ideas- serves to amplify a frequent lyrical motif: the sensation that one body, one lifetime, isn’t big enough for what you’re feeling. The record is pregnant with memories shared across more than one mind, recalling the storytelling antagonisms of Nina Simone at her most strident and unpredictable. In response, the rhythmic aggressions of her music have grown even more determined and psychedelic, drawing a line in fire between Jimmy Jam’s turnt industrialism on Control and the furious unease of Red Mecca- era Cabaret Voltaire. With a palate equal parts chrome and dirt, ice and depth, Lafawndah’s finesse with song architecture imbues the LP with an uncanny addictiveness: anthems loaded with trap doors. ANCESTOR BOY imagines a pop music that is neither imperial nor local, but a freedom of movement; a residue, perhaps, from the album’s nomadic creation between Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York, London, and Paris.” less"

It’s really just a collection of songs as rudimentary as that sounds,” Khotin-Foote explains. But the title of the album arrives with some lore: in high school, Khotin-Foote found a handwritten note on his windshield that read “Beautiful you, thanks for the smile.” Whoever left the note, they gifted the producer with this anonymous phrase that perfectly suits the work now, here, years later. Paired with the record’s cover, an ASCII-rendered photo of his mother and her parents living temporarily in Italy as refugees in the '80s, the information graphs a malleable outline for listeners to shape into their own experience. A sensation akin to déjà vu, of misremembered hospitable climes, broadcast via ambiguous transmissions, birdsongs, melody and static. Songs drift at a leisure; environments and voices pass by, some distinguishable, others pitched down or truncated to single words. In the case of “Vacation,” the message comes into focus over time, beginning in fragments, assembling above a suspended note to sublime effect. On “Merged Host,” a cycle of melodic phrases becomes punctuated by a clipped half-time beat and injected with a sample’s reoccurring comic relief (“I am so happy / how great I am”). On album closer “Planet B,” nostalgia is encountered head-on, with coiling and smooth synth lines twisted and spiraling around a nodding and assured percussion pattern.” less"

   "name": "This stunning first outing on Yves Tumor’s Grooming label was released this summer in a run of just 100 copies and is already selling for sillies second hand. For us it's easily one of the most overlooked and vital releases of the year - this new edition comes with new artwork in a run of 200 copies, an essential cop for those of you yet to experience its wildly original mix of choral aggression and cavernous percussion sounding quite unlike anything else we heard in 2018. Sepulchral, majestic, Kill is John Bence’s sophomore release following a début for Nico Jaar’s Other People in 2015. Since then Bence has also appeared as part of Ashley Paul’s new ensemble on her striking LP, Lost In Shadows for Slip, as well as playing in support of Grouper earlier this year. Where Bence’s first record, Disquiet was a sort of palimpsest of re-scored composition, Kill finds him unfurl a shocking three part movement for vocals, cello and bellicose drums that should leave no one uncertain of his talents. And in that sense it’s really not hard to hear why his music has been snapped up for release by Yves Tumor’s label, as the pair patently share a feel for music both fuelled by and navigating overwhelming emotion. In the first part, he shapeshifts from something like prime, latter day Coil in a section of reverberant cello and ghostly keening, to erupt in Prurient like howls and psychotomimetic scat like a possessed, Welsh mining choir. By contrast, the 2nd part is pure entropy, vocals layered and decaying into extremes of the soundfield, leading to a passage recalling Aíne O’Dwyer’s haunted situations, before a real denouement comes with the sublime closing coda of vaulted vocals into noirish strings and recursive industrial percussion. Keep a very close eye on this one... less"

There’s also a shorter Instrumental which is pretty much an alternate mix of Maurizio’s M6, and a nipped edit of the vocal mix, all demanding that DJs buy two copies to really get the most out of it.

Galvanising and accelerating garage and techno with cuttingly crisp tonal diction and pointillist percussive palette, ‘A Rational Tangle’ demonstrates Treanor’s adroit and finely-nurtured rhythmelodic instincts through a quicksilver syntax of kerned, polychromatic 2-step patterns and whipsmart, emotive jit music. The EP’s four tracks vacillate ping-pong ballistics and recursive melodic motifs constructed in Max/MSP, dancing from pendulous, aerobic minimalism to taut, synthetic tabla grooves with grid melting nous, whilst also taking in gamelan-esque hypeR&B through wormholes of smeared and curdled harmonics, plus one dead lush section of Detroit-via-Yorkshire styled hi-tech funk. The production is stainlessly dry and future-proof whilst Rian’s arrangements are considerately efficient, yet it’s all blessed with a pop or ’floor-ready turn of phrase that reveals new kinks, fills and twysts with each return listen. Whichever angle you view it from ‘A Rational Tangle’ forms a rewarding introduction to the work of a very promising and distinct new voice in electronic music. less"

   "name": "Beautifully by-passing our expectations, performance artist/musician Pan Daijing’s first major work Lack yields a spellbinding demonstration, or “purgative finale”, to her improvised live performances over the past two years; offering a far more nuanced and probing suite of electronic gestures than her gnarled handful of slamming, salty tapes and 12”s for Bedouin Records, Power Vacuum or Noisekölln Tapes since 2015. Extracted and edited from field recordings and live documentation of her concerts made in Europe, China, and Canada, Daijing aptly describes the album as “an opera piece”, from the soaring soprano and flustered strings of Phenomenon thru the convulsive industrial throb of Act of The Empress, to the possessed folk energies condensed in The Nerve Eater and the closing trance induction of Lucid Morto with an effect recalling something like Diamond Galas conducting a court ritual with Black Mecha and Jani Christou. Daijing’s process is multi-disciplinary, featuring improvised sound and movement that feed off one another in a painstaking mental and physical practice that draws energy from the moment. The reduction and selection of the recordings which make up the album felt “more like a psychoanalytical process” explains Daijing, feeling like “this absurd, mad person ‘acting’ out the sounds… All things naturally came out of me”, and in the edit she effectively detaches and controls the listener’s gaze, offering what could be viewed as an almost voyeuristic document of those intimate, private energies. less"

   "name": "The second instalment from Basic Channel's offshoot, Basic Replay, a reissue label convened to showcase prime influences and lesser known inspirations, the men from Berlin have selected and remastered a truly shocking follow up to Keith Hudson's 'Playing It Cool..' album reissued last year. 'Call me rambo' was originally recorded in 1986 and released on the Heavyweight label, an imprint formed by the Heavyweight soundsystem, based in the Wood Green and Tottenham areas of north London. Featuring Chester Roots at the controls and his nephew Ackie at the microphone, this is raw and dangerous english dancehall. Hailing from that blissful period in the middle eighties, when clubs could play Marley Marl next to Super Cat, or Half Pint next to early Trax records, 'Call Me Rambo' opens with a bang, racked with strafing machine gun fire and the helicopter sounds free with a Commodore 64, natty dread a go scientific an' ballistic. Stylistically speaking, Ackie's voice is reminiscent of the great Barrington Levy, and the simply enormous, rampant rhythm sends shockwaves through any musical system - all b-boys and hardcore addicts would do well to sweep a copy of this and ask questions later. Flip the script, and Chesse retains Ackie's winning 'Don't push me' refrain, and much of the sonic elements but works the board hard, 'Rambo Gun Salute' as a part two is simply perfection, dubwise and anywise. 'Rambo Salute' takes the dub even further out, as Ackie drifts further into the mix, and Chester works it on out in true ragamuffin style. \"Ramming dancehall is the priority\", so the man say. This has shattered the office record for rewinds this week and is utterly essential for ALL self-respecting music fans. Buy it. less"

   "name": "‘Electrucs’ is a previously unpublished LP of works by former INA-GRM chief François Bayle, recorded 1974-1995, and now finally issued on the 60th anniversary of the world-renowned facility he managed between 1966-1997. Comprising four distinct sections of acousmatic study ranging from playful AKS Synthi “hand games” to the blooming ‘Rosaces’, a test-piece for the Acousmonium, and a dedication to his peer, Bernard Parmegiani; ‘Electrucs’ follows Recollection GRM’s series of Bayle reissues to offer a diverse and spellbinding survey of his pioneering work spanning the past half century. The A-side is taken by 10 oozing, viscously shapeshifting ‘Electrucs’ that give the LP its title, rendering a series of highly dynamic pieces made on the Synthi AKS between 1974-2018, and veering from chaotic polymetrics to pulsating, almost melodic vignettes, and many moments of tense, atonal abstraction that wouldn’t sound out of place on a good hour or thriller soundtrack. The other side breaks down to three distinct sections. ‘Cinq dessins en rosace’ [1973] is a five part study of increasingly complex geometries, transiting from sharp, simple oscillations to filigree, spatialized arrangements of electronics and keys. ‘Foliphonie’ [1974-2011] follows with a beautifully alien scene of chirruping voices and whirled woodwind originally hatched for use on the GRM’s Acousmonium speaker/diffusion system, and ’Marpège’ [1995-2007] finds him dissolving a trace of Bernard Parmegiani’s ‘Sonare’ into sonic delirium. Stunning material. less"

   "name": "Two of the great unsung protagonists binding Manchester’s DIY scene unite for this limited edition release taking in some of the many multidisciplinary interests the pair have been involved with as sound and visual artists. John Powell-Jones is perhaps best known for his work in the creative arts and as a visual designer and printer for projects as diverse as Mogwai, Jamal Moss, Delroy Edwards, Raime, Moon Duo and Demdike Stare, as well as a technical demonstrator in printmaking and Risograph techniques at the University of Salford. Alongside his most recent work in sculpture, Powell-Jones has also had a number of music releases for the Sacred Tapes label since 2014. Craig Tattersall needs little introduction round these parts, having been involved in numerous projects close to our orbit since the late 90’s as part of Hood, The Remote Viewer and The Boats, as well as running the much loved (and missed) Cotton Goods label. This release emerged as the result of a sound art and print workshop the duo ran together at the University of Salford, based on a premise of capturing sounds during the process of printing. The resulting prints would act as both 'sketches' of the workshop, but also as gestural marks that would replicate those sounds, like a visual score. Making use of contact mics, tape loops, manipulated radios/cassettes and an altered turntable to make the sound, the pair then used different mono printing and dry point etching techniques, as well as an old typewriter to make the images. The A-side starts off baring the hallmarks of classic location recording; all clicks and whirrs, it slowly develops into a mesmerising, whirling drone piece. But it’s the b-side that envelopes in warmth, a sublime study in stillness and beauty that’s quite the contrast to the rattling, microscopic chaos of that opener. Over the space of almost 20 minutes, Tattersall and Powell-Jones bridge between celestial and personal dimensions with ease, creating a kind of barely-there rendering of the sublime that recalls everything from William Basinski to the quiet music of Jürg Frey, an effect heightened by the ferric quality of the recording... less"

   "name": "Unique psychedelic killers from Niagara, mounting a sterling debut album with Lisbon’s Príncipe five years after their first 12”, ‘Ouro Oeste’ [2013]. Trust that they have lost none of the weirdness that’s endeared them to freaks around the world ever since they emerged. If anything they’re stranger, more spaced-out and porous to wild influence... Outlining Niagara’s definitive description of contemporary exotica, ‘Apologia’ limns a frayed, buzzing sort of “Fourth World PLUS” sound, where the “PLUS” refers to their embrace of noise as an agent of chaos. But it’s not necessarily malefic chaos, and should be taken as a smart acknowledgement of the overlooked yet crucial role that roughness of grain and construction play in contrast with so many clinically smooth and even anodyne efforts from the same, imagined arena of worldly music for a new age. In allowing for the entropy of time and the inevitable infidelity of attrition to enter their soundsphere, Niagara’s organic machine music keenly reflects a natural world order without the need for algorithmic process. Their world is a fertile interplay of acoustic and electronic sources rendering hazy, fata morgana-like glimpses of musical possibility, practically triangulating the visions of likeminds such as Jamal Moss/Hieroglyphic Being and Dolo Percussion with the explorative precedents of Portugul’s Telectu to realise a fine expression of anachronistic modernism. Most of the tracks loosely work around 3 minute timeframes, lending a zig-zagging mosaic quality to the tracklist in between its longer parts. Richly colourful spiritual jazz arps and raw machine grooves spring from opener ‘França’, triggering a cascade of ideas that bends between acidic kosmiche in ‘6:30’ to the heatsick boogie gliss of ’40’ and the stark emptiness of ‘Senhora Do Cabo’, to give up the gorgeous, extended flute and acid meditation ’Siena’, and mess with Vangelis-style synth majesty on ‘Via Garibaldi’, before spending their coolest energies in the drowsy Afro-latin swagger of ‘Cabo Verde.’ It’s hard to ignore the fact that Alberto, António and Sara a.k.a. Niagara have distilled their sound to imperfection on ‘Apologia’, resulting one of 2018’s most crucial and vital electronic albums. less"

   "name": "18th anniversary of one of Trunk’s earliest and most sought-after sides; John Cameron’s sweeping string and woodwind score for ‘Kes’ [1969] As possibly one of the most widely referenced portraits of Northern England, the imagery and soundtrack of Ken Loach’s ‘Kes’ hold a special place in British 20th century culture. For reasons unknown, the soundtrack was never released until Jonny Trunk came along in the late ‘90s and made it the follow-up to his release of another equally classic British film soundtrack, 'The Wicker Man’, and it’s now a foundational part of the Trunk label. Where ‘The Wicker Man’ played to ancient, arcane folk spirits in Scotland, ‘Kes’ is a study in gritty realism, portraying a sweetly romanticised image of youth and the working classes in post-industrial Yorkshire. John Cameron fits the film’s images of gridiron streets, grey skies and rolling hills perfectly with arrangements of flute, clarinet and harp that beautifully match the kindred spirits of Billy, a bullied kid in Barnsley, and his pet bird, Kes. less"

   "name": "The gobsmacking ‘Selected Early Keyboard Works’ forms the first full length vinyl release by Catherine Christer Hennix, a peerless Swedish polymath whose uniquely diverse yet holistic contributions to early American minimalism and experimental music are cultishly appreciated by those in the know, yet remain sorely overlooked in the broader history of 20th century music. As anyone who has heard Catherine’s classic ‘The Electric Harpsichord’, her hypnotic ‘Dharma warriors’ with Henry Flynt, or the stunning Chora(s)san Time-Court Mirage and The Deontic Miracle CDs will surely attest, her compositions exist on a whole other plane of musical perception. They naturally embrace a complexity of expression that places science and maths at the service of art, resulting some of the most beguiling, enigmatic and unprecedented combinations of styles - Indian raga, jazz, drone, early electronics - that we’ve ever heard, at the least. In keeping with that enigma, the label’s notes for ‘Selected Early Keyboard Works’, ambiguously imply they were recorded in 1976 circa The Deontic Miracle’s 1976 performance at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, which was issued on CD in 2016 as ‘Central Palace Music (From 100 Model Subjects For Hegikan Roku)’. If we use our ears, and take an educated guess, though, we’d date these previously unheard pieces to the same period, which makes them even more remarkable in context of that fertile period of musical thought. We’ll forever fail to fully place a finger on the magick of Catherine’s music, but there’s a play of paradoxes at work in her music - mischievous yet meditative; light yet somehow driving, and even psychoactively aggressive - which makes it stand way out from her field. It’s definitely not just another new age whimsy or academic exercise. It’s much better described as intuitively daring and hallucinatory, setting out noumenal space for logic-defying feats of imagination and musical virtuosity. In the two parts of ‘Mode Nouvelle des modalitiés’ for well-tuned Fender Rhodes and sine wave drone, listeners will discover a masterfully alien mix of early electronic music’s mercurial freedom and razor sharp jazz chops, inseparably blending her formative, teenaged experience of listening to jazz luminaries such as Coltrane and Cecil Taylor play in Sweden, with later studies at EMS and playing alongside La Monte Young and Henry Flynt in NYC. In revealing contrast, ‘Equal Temperament Fender Mix’ follows on the same Rhodes but in twelve-tone equal temperament, also using a tape delay system akin to Terry Riley’s, yet with a more reflective, blue and psychedelic appeal that’s far more interesting to us than Riley’s hirsute ecstasies. And ‘The Well Tuned Marimba’ for well-tuned Yamaha, shoeing, sine wave and live electronics completes the set in suitably, subtly breathtaking style with 18 minute of trickling, iridescent rhythmelody and curdling timbre limning a lush lysergic episode. While we can point to her influences - from Cecil Taylor to Pandit Pran Nath and the EMS facility - what Catherine does with them is little short of alchemy, and provides some of the most curious music you’ll ever hear. We can barely wait to see what this long overdue series brings to the table... less"

Her voice is exquisitely fragile but poised and confident with it; representing an unshowy resolve which, despite its gothic chic, actually feels fresh and necessary - operating counter to contemporary glitz and glamour with clear allusions to her heroes, such as Nico or Anna Domino. Prefaced by two single tracks, the departing dream of Fast Moving Cars and the ghostly nerve pincher What You Gonna Do Now? the album also features six new songs clocking in at just under half an hour, following a bedsit slug trail from the mildew sprawl and nitrate bubble of opener Italian Cinema to the ‘floor-stalking sleep house thud of DB Rip and a deep drifting instrumental, Dry In The Rain, strewn with melodica-like pipes and cobwebbed in acoustic guitar strum like some dusty eldritch dub of A C Marias. In the album’s twilight hours, Carla really comes into her own on the title song, flitting between Crepulscule-esque songcraft and slow-rocking traces of UK dub, her vocals urgent but nevertheless nonchalant, before Dragon Breath recedes back into the mists of chamber music and she proceeds to pour a potent, near paralysing nightcap and shuffle away from the screen down a long corridor, fading to black in The Same Reply.

Totally the kind of thing you’d expect to hear sunburnt germans stomping to in Goa circa ’92.

   "name": "Through her latest, ‘Titanic Rising’, Weyes Blood, aka Natalie Mering, has designed her own universe to soulfully navigate life’s mysteries. Manoeuvring through a space time continuum, she plays the role of melodic, sometimes melancholic, anthropologist. \"Tellingly, Mering classifies ‘Titanic Rising’ - written and recorded during the first half of 2018, after three albums and years of touring - as The Kinks meeting WWII or Bob Seger meets Enya. The latter captures the album’s wilful expansiveness (“You can tell there’s not a guy pulling the strings in Enya’s studio,” she notes, admiringly). The former relays her imperative to connect with listeners. “The clarity of Bob Seger is unmistakable. I’m a big fan of conversational songwriting,” she adds. “I just try to do that in a way that uses abstract imagery as well.” The Weyes Blood frontwoman grew up singing in gospel and madrigal choirs. (Listen closely to ‘Titanic Rising’ and you’ll also hear the jazz of Hoagy Carmichael mingle with the artful mysticism of Alejandro Jodorowsky and the monomyth of scholar Joseph Campbell.) ‘Something To Believe’, a confessional that makes judicious use of the slide guitar, touches on that cosmological upbringing. “Belief is something all humans need. Shared myths are part of our psychology and survival,” she says. “Now we have a weird mishmash of capitalism and movies and science. There have been moments where I felt very existential and lost.” As a kid, she filled that void with ‘Titanic’. (Yes, the movie.) “It was engineered for little girls and had its own mythology,” she explains. Mering also noticed that the blockbuster romance actually offered a story about loss born of man’s hubris. “It’s so symbolic that The Titanic would crash into an iceberg, and now that iceberg is melting, sinking civilization.” Today, this hubris also extends to the relentless adoption of technology, at the expense of both happiness and attention spans. But Weyes Blood isn’t one to stew. Her observations play out in an ethereal saunter: far more meditative than cynical. To Mering, listening and thinking are concurrent experiences. “There are complicated influences mixed in with more relatable nostalgic melodies,” she says. “In my mind my music feels so big, a true production. I’m not a huge, popular artist, but I feel like one when I’m in the studio. But it’s never taking away from the music. I’m just making a bigger nspace for myself.” less"

   "name": "Visible Cloaks meet two of their influences, Yoshio Ojima & Satsuki Shibano, in a beautiful effort to expand and refine their ambient-environmental gestures with firmer architectural underpinnings. For our ¥ it’s the most sublime episode in RVNG Intl.’s intergenerational ‘FRKWYS’ series so far Between them, Yoshio Ojima & Satsuki Shibano are part responsible for a lot of music that prompted Visible Cloaks to life. Yoshio Ojima is a composer of environmental and ambient music, with a bias toward the possibilities of generative software. Together with pianist Satsuki Shibano, known for his renditions of Debussy and Satie, they programmed influential radio experiment St. Giga’s constant stream of field recordings, sound collage and readings of Japanese poetry, often read by Satsuki. Recordings of St. Giga was a big inspiration for Visible Cloaks first records, so its a natural conclusion for them to work together, and the results are divine. Pursuing mutual passions for St. Giga’s remit, as well as the Lovely Music, Ltd. catalogue and the British avant-garde, they arrived at a number of creative strategies for the creation of ‘serenitatem’ in Tokyo, late 2017. From MIDI randomisation to text-to-MIDI generative software, the process lends a variable to their music which sweetly blurs distinctions between the programmed and the serendipitous, making their music simultaneously timeless and futuristic, and most of all optimistically utopian. In effect, they’ve conjured a modern echo of St, Giga, opening a place where sounds illusively occur, emerging form the minimalist but detailed matrix only to metamorphose on sight, and drift back into the parallel dimension whence they came, implying that we’re only teasingly hearing aspects of a greater shape which they’re so carefully describing. less"

   "name": "16 hours of peerless, important works by Eliane Radigue relating to her work with the ARP 2500 synthesiser between 1971-2000. Prior to this period, Eliane worked exclusively with feedback on tape and oscillators, but her work from the ‘70s onward is defined by an uniquely meditative and transcendent grasp of microtonal minimalism which has latterly come to place her among the 20th century’s most esteemed and truly inimitable composers. Bearing in mind that Eliane realised this fathomless body of work in her Paris apartment away from professional recording studios, only makes it resonate more strongly with the idea that Eliane was a genuine outlier whose uniquely sober work divined an unquantifiable yet ultimately human nature in electronic music. \"Eliane Radigue was born in Paris. She studied “musique concrète” techniques at the “Studio d’Essai” of the RTF under the direction of Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry (1956-57). She was married to the painter and sculptor Arman and devoted ten years to their three children. She then worked with Pierre Henry, as his assistant at the Studio APSOME (1967-68). She was in residence at the New York University School of Arts (1970-71), the University of Iowa and the California Institute of the Arts (1973) and Mills College (1998). She has created sound environments using looped tapes of various durations, gradually desynchronising. Her works have been featured in numerous galleries and museums since the late 60s and from 1970, she has been associated to the ARP 2500 Synthesizer and tape through many compositions from Chry-ptus (1970) up to L’Île resonante (2000). These include: Biogenesis, Arthesis, Ψ 847, Adnos I, II and III (70s), Les Chants de Milarepa and Jetsun Mila (80s) and the three pieces constituting the Trilogie de la Mort (1988-91-93). Since 2002, she has been composing mostly acoustic works for performers and instruments. Her music has been featured in major international festivals. Her extremely sober, almost ascetic concerts, are made of a continuous, ever-changing yet extremely slow stream of sound, whose transformation occurs within the sonic material itself. Radigue found her musical voice through the decisive encounter with “musique concrète” and its founding fathers. With Pierre Schaeffer, first, and then Pierre Henry, with whom she learned and perfected the art of tape recorders. She then developed a unique style by herself, freely continuing the exploration of electronic sounds, progressing with tenacity through her musical quest, without worrying about current trends or fashions, paying no attention to creeds or dogmas. An isolated course, out with fashions and institutions, such a singular and intense music, so remote from everything...\" less"

Where his earliest work was indebted to or paralleled the bold futurism of Detroit techno and its UK antecedents from AFX and the Rephlex crew, and later releases found him diving headlong into deep house inspirations and killer disco edits as part of Tiger & Woods, on ‘W.O.W.’ Passarani combines intense technicality with intuitive dancefloor suss in eight glorious parts that form a full image of his style. From the early ‘90s new age promise of ‘Coldrain’ with its Plastikman-like slow/fast drums and melancholic euphoria, to the woozy deep house charm of ‘Strings Fair’, he charts a course thru 25 years of deep dancefloor history, coming off like Cybotron jamming with Alexander Robotnick in ‘Drumy Dream’, while ‘Get Down’ delivers screaming payload of Chicago house/EBM, ‘Innowave’ trades in exquisite instrumental synth-pop, and ‘Minerals’ works out an infectious blend of NYC and SoYo garage depths, before ‘’Talk To Me’ reels with ribboning chromatic arps, then momentarily turns into a Hoover driven house beast.

   "name": "Jan Jelinek and legendary jazz percussionist Sven-Åke Johansson probe ideas about the “anthropology of drumming” with entrancing results for Luxembourg’s Ni-Vu-Ni-Connu label. A sterling addition to Jelinek’s catalogue of solo releases and experimental collaborations, ‘puls-plus-puls’ finds the German artist properly indulging a formative passion for jazz music alongside one of free-jazz music’s most respected percussionists. Of course, this being Jelinek, the results are craftily complex but underlined by a hypnotic quality and bedevilling precision that’s always been key to his best work. On the most immediate level, ‘puls-plus-puls’ is a steeply absorbing display of rhythmic psychedelia and percussive voodoo, pairing Johannsson’s sizzling, free-metered fray with Jelinek’s electronically penned patterns and iridescent drones. On another level, however, it’s a study in the nature and semantics of both machine and human-driven drumming styles. Jelinek & Johansson’s follow a long tradition of German artists fascinated by rhythm-driven music - from Can and Kraftwerk, to Neu!, Basic Channel and T++, while also dovetailing with Mark Fell’s arrhythmic click-guided percussionists on last year’s acclaimed ‘Intra’ LP. Over the piece’s morphing composition, it’s difficult to separate the machine from the man, or expressive inflection from pure precision: the two are beautifully bound in a richly tactile, haptic, psychedelic roil that highlights percussive music’s ancient history, while questioning its ambiguous, human context in the binary information age. less"

Continuing Shelter Press’s on-going documentation of Gisèle Vienne’s work after Stephen O’Malley’s 2015 score for her ‘Éternelle Idole’ piece, ‘The Pyre’ also sees Gisèle paired with Peter Rehberg for first time since his ‘Work For GV 2004-2008’ album, serving to tie up their many, long-running and overlapping strands of practice into a mighty new KTL opus. As almost anyone who’s heard O’Malley & Rehberg scores for Gisele’s work will surely attest, the french choreographer always brings the best out of her sonic familiars, and their work on ‘The Pyre’ is no exception. Some 6 years in the works, it has undergone multiple stages of processing since the initial seed recording made at IRCAM, Paris, 2012, with subsequent live stems overdubbed at Fennesz’s studio, and further mixing by Randall Dunn all aiding to bring the score to life as it’s own, standalone work of art. At the service of Gisèle’s choreography - a play on the existential tension between presence and absence - KTL render some of the most pellucid and unfathomable sound designs in their considerable arsenal, layering up from near infrasonic-levels of subharmonics to filigree timbral thizz and sferic reflection, in the process creating an illusion of spatial depth and dizzy scale that beautifully spins our gauges... less"

Gibbons really doesn’t do things by halves, here committing to singing Górecki’s ‘Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs)’ in Polish - a language she doesn’t speak - after an intense period of preparation in which she not only learnt the lyrics, but also their emotional provenance. Conducted by Krzystof Penderecki, the piece proves a perfect platform for Beth’s lesser heard gift for operatic gymnastics, which, once heard, will beg the question why she hasn't made this kind of recording before. Most poignantly, we’re left on tenterhooks for the opening 12 minutes of the first movement, until the strings usher in her towering, if fleeting vocal to astonishing effect, before she tempers that drama to a much slower, etheric appeal throughout the 2nd movement, and then with a fine grasp of the nuances of Polish enunciation in the 3rd and final movement, without losing her aching cadence.

The opening, 30 minute live recording ‘Premonition’ starts anxiously jagged but beautifully warms up as he channels the sun beating down on the Desert Daze festival stage, opening out into the kind of curdled tunings that make our heads fizz, and which we imagine must have sounded incredible in open space. Another live piece ‘Slow Ascent’ follows, glacially coning from wide, lo lying into a peak of looped voice and strings, before the album’s single studio recording ‘A Person With Feelings’ plays to his full range, segueing from luxuriant to atonal with discernibly electronic designs cut to purpose as the soundtrack to a short film by Tamer Smith. Trust we’ll hear more from this bright star in future. “\"'Premonition' (October 12, 2018) was recorded on the first day of Desert Daze music festival. For this performance I tuned my violin in open G (G-D-G-D) for the very first time. The afternoon was warm and bright, but storm clouds, yet to be seen at the time of this recording, loomed on the horizon. My improvisation began in the present moment, reflecting the vibrations of the sun. Once locked in with these higher frequencies, the instrument took control and painted the evening. This performance was both a premonition of night and an astral projection towards the clouds crawling towards the festival grounds, catalyzed by an instrument resonating with the frequencies of the earth. 'Slow Ascent' (February 23, 2018) was recorded at Human Resources, Los Angeles, for an event celebrating the release of Yann Novak's second album. This performance was an inverted guided group meditation. In front of my biggest audience to date, I was extremely anxious. Rather than letting my nerves lead the way, I fed off of the energies of the audience, letting their patience, calm and warmth guide the instrument. 'A Person With Feelings' is a score for a short abstract film to be released in 2019. A modern trance film, the piece follows a young actor's internal journey. The soundscape reflects the arc of the film and showcases the textural range of my instrument.\" --Zachary Paul less"

That reminds me of the words of Pina Bausch “Dance, dance or we are lost”. Lost in our internal struggles as individuals (or imaginary twins). Lost in a society where our relation to the other is often marked by fear, power or violence. We feel the need to resist. Yet nowadays, taking a political stance as an artist is too often being instrumentalised as another tactics or accessory to gather more popularity, reducing the political message to nothing else but a branding attempt. Isn’t it anyway the power of capitalism to assimilate everything, even contradictory or once-upon-a-time subversive voices? All to end up on a “Rave” or “Feminist” H&M t-shirt. Slogans that have been emptied of their initial force and substance, now replaced by their commercial value. I strongly doubt that more empty words poured in vain on social media will help us much. But, like Pina Bausch, like JD Twitch, I have always firmly believed in dancing as a physical, social and fundamental act that leads us to share a common space with others and embrace otherness.

As the label explain, Sage approached the album from an impressionistic perspective, painting sound in broad strokes conveying the ecstatic warmth you only really feel when you look at the sun with closed eyes. \"The moods and modes are constantly, entirely at odds with themselves: private vs. public, abject vs. profound, rural vs. urban(e), and so on. Where other players of experimental studio music take a more high-minded, often stuffy approach, 'Catch a Blessing' floats in airier, more refreshing modes.. endlessly lush but sincerely marked by decay...\" An effortlessly lovely offering from the same label that gave us Félicia Atkinson’s sublime ‘Coyotes’ last year. less"

   "name": "‘Contrée’ is Recollection GRM’s first survey of work by Régis Renouard Larivière, three pieces variously exploring granular evolutions (‘Contrée’), hacked strings (‘Allégeance volatile’), and a rapid, chattering avian flux (‘Esquive’). This is one of the harder nosed GRM issues, but those with attentive ears and patience will be rewarded in multiples... “Allégeance volatile and Esquive each tackle the same issue in their own way. Overcoming time: whether it be successive, additional, enumerative, or repetitive. However, there is nothing here about the ensuing nature of so-called \"repetitive\" music. These are types of high-end music. And it is more about insistence, the obstinacy of an individual who keeps knocking on a door that will never open. Allégeance's rustic drumming, talkative, acidulous, colourful and overarticulated, with almost clownish desinences, eventually dies out in this very respite. The iterative and puffy shimmering of Esquive with its dull, thin and precise sounds, shifts and is engulfed into another sonic world — which appears as a gaping and collapsed response to this prime insistency. This is, indeed, a ‘volatile allegiance’ and ‘avoidance’ from the sonic to the musical elements: the musical phenomenon anticipated and pursued as the non-sound of sound — or, in other words, the void of sound. This seems to be the lesson of the concrete attitude in music. Such is the kind of questioning that stirs the composer. He returns with another title: Contrée, which, once again, speaks of a counter-event. Here, the movement is broader, more generous, more confident. Time spreads and stretches out. What seems to be a landscape of entanglements, trajectories, influx, masses and points emerges. “Something” rises and presents itself out of the sounds - these escaping beings, these \"relatively short combustion flames \" (Schaeffer). The piece consists of five consecutive and uninterrupted parts: Entrée and Stance I — Véhémence de l’air and Stance II — Grande Allure. It is the central section of an electroacoustic triptych with Sables (2011) as the first and Nil (2017) as the last. Contrée is dedicated to Philippe Mion, whose friendly ears have been entrusted with my music for so many years. - Régis Renouard Larivière” less"

It’s a perfect example of Ferrari’s fascination with observing daily life, and finding poetry in the prosaic. \"Music Promenade', composed in 1969, has been realized from a certain number of recording I have done on journeys in different European countries. The first purpose of this realization was an acoustic installation based on four independent tape machines unfolding the tapes in loops. Thus this sound events scattered to the four corners of the hall met one another permanently in an aleatoric (generated by random means) encounter. The duration of the piece was indefinite. So the issue on CD is an immovable version of a possible stabilized mix version. Each of the four tapes was about twenty minutes long (each tape has a different duration so that the cycles can never encounter in the same manner). The structure of each tape consists of a succession of short characteristic an dynamic sequences alternating with blurred and slight, sometimes nearly silent sounds. When one characteristic sequence encounters by chance a slight sound, this one colors that one. On the other hand, when an event sequence encounters another one, they perturb each other, for their good or for their evil. Such is life.When I consider this piece now, I notice that I am still working on the same principles of random variations that create encounters and superimpositions of cycles that combine themselves by alteration. This concept I called « tautology » in the 1960s is still present in my recent compositions. - Luc Ferrari” less"

Setting a new high-water mark for UK dance-related albums, ‘Imperial Flood’ stakes a claim for Logos as a key dramaturgist of all things darkside, techy and skooled in the hardcore ‘nuum. Where his debut album highlighted links between ‘90s Metalheadz D&B, Wiley’s Devil mixes, and contemporary sci-fi cinema on its deliciously noirish soundstage, with ‘Imperial Flood’ he expands that aesthetic to widescreen HD. Pulling in broader influence from acid and dub techno, experimental computer music, D&B minimalism and the speculative literature of Jeff VanderMeer, Christopher Priest, Lando and JG Ballard, the results vividly speak to the idea of a UK sound as a product of its brutalist, paranoid environment. Arriving 10 years since his debut 12”, and five after his seminal debut album, ‘Imperial Flood comes after a significant period of creativity for Logos. Over the latter half of this decade he’s been instrumental in new grime movements, co-running London’s acclaimed club night, Boxed, whilst also diversifying his bonds with Mumdance and Shapednoise as part of improvising noise trio, The Sprawl, and most importantly with Different Circles; a label/clubnight catalyst responsible for boundary-pushing dances and a number of cult releases from Airhead, Rabit, Szare and Raime, not to mention his own, standout EPs with Mumdance such as ‘2015’s ‘Proto’. It’s not difficult to hear how this activity has fed deep forward in ‘Imperial Flood’. From the bullet-time Matrix-style into of ‘Arrival (T2 Mix)’ thru the hair-kissing weightless rave sensation of ‘Weather System Over Plaistow’, he sucks listeners into an utterly convincing soundworld made all the more visceral, “real” thru his exacting production, morphing from the sentinel-bot growls of ‘Marsh Lantern’ to lush viscous/arid acid ambience in ‘Flash Forward (Ambi Mix)’, and Dynamo-style dub on ‘Lighthouse Dub’, before tagging in Mumdance on the Stingray-meets-Autechre styles of ‘Zoned In’, and freezing the dance with commanding force on ‘Stentorian’. Ultimately there’s no shortage of imitators for this style, but Logos’ combination of dedication to his craft, a classically forward stylistic nous, and unique grasp of narrative places ‘Imperial Flood’ in a rare echelon of UK music really shared only by the likes of Burial and Raime. less"

Zoë Sinatra’s ‘Mais Qu’Est-Ce Que Tu Fumes?’ hugs the B-side like a velvet bodysuit. Produced by legendary New Beat guy, Gery François (Teknokrat’s), it’s much slower and sexier than his club gear, destined for the after-party and quite possibly directing you to the cold shower Zoë mentions in the song. less"

Originally released by Factory Records in December 1990, the original 10 tracks have now been expanded to no less than 43. The Durutti Column’s overlooked foray into early ‘90s acid house, techno and Balearic dance resurfaces, expanded with bonus discs of related material, and packaged with notes by Tony Wilson. In 1990, gassed on ecstasy fumes and weed pills, Reilly pulled influence from Acid House, rave and Balearic dance music into his singular style of lolling, latinate guitar playing with lovely and commonly overlooked results. Aware of what could be done with a sampler - where one chord could trigger myriad more at the push of a button - Vini mostly self-produced ‘Obey The Time’, with some help from local studio whizzes such as Bruce Mitchell and Keir Stewart. The resulting album revolved natty acid house aces such as ‘Contra-Indications’ with Vini sailing over its rude machine groove, along with the balmier. dubbed-out ‘Fridays’, plus the utopian bliss of choral synth voices and Afro-Latin groove in ‘Neon’, while this reissue also includes ‘The Together Mix’ by local rave heroes Together (of ‘Hardcore Uproar’ fame), as well as Keir’s schism jungle mix ‘Kiss Of Def’, and the shimmering synth voices of ‘Zinni III’ exclusive to this boxset. On the 2nd disc is a stack of ‘Related Works’ including a Select Magazine megamix of the album, plus compilation tracks ‘Dry’ [1991] and ‘Red Shoes’ [1992], plus songs from unreleased albums, while the 3rd disc documents The Durutti Column’s concert at Manchester Uni’s Whitworth Hall, 23rd June 1990, aka ‘The Acid Guitar’.

Separated from the need to accompany hopping pixels, she emotes a classically modernist melancholy that crisply but gently resonates with ‘90s trip hop, shoegaze and IDM/electronica prisms as much as the sort of Japanese new age ambient styles currently explored by Visible Cloaks. Considering that the last computer game I played was probably Abe’s Odyssey, as a nipper, around 20 years ago, our knowledge of contemporary game soundtracks is limited to say the least. But no knowledge of that arena is required to enjoy ‘Oneknowing’, which is simply a beautiful album for home listening, utterly flush with ear-worming melodies and and a glowing pleasantness that’s just hard to shake, especially if you like anything from Tenniscoats to Ulrich Schnauss, Boards of Canada or 0PN. less"

Remastered from original tapes. 2nd hand copies aren’t cheap! “Politico dub-collage practitioners Guerrilla Welfare came from Edmonton, Alberta, coincidentally the birthplace of prophetic media sage Marshall McLuhan. Armed with vanguard ideas taken from Steve Reich, Fela Kuti, Robert Fripp and Material, the duo of Curtis Ruptash and Brian Schultze adopted the “studio as instrument” mindset of Eno and King Tubby creating complex textural and polyrhythmic sonic insurgencies. They overdubbed drum computers, guitar, bass, noise-makers, mallet percussion, sitars, often accompanied by sampled vocals and found sound taken from TV. Their pan-global, multi-media palette supported zeitgeist commentary — often, with a healthy dose of gallows humour — on gender, power structures, and sexual and geopolitical tensions in the late 80s. Their DIY bunker studio experimentations align them with genre defying dub-infused outfits like African Head Charge, Dome, Lifetones, Naffi, Woo, Negativeland and The Residents. The Nature of Human Nature captures Guerilla Welfare’s most formidable output, compiling tracks selected from their entire discography (two LPs and a cassette collaboration with poet Mary Howes), all originally self-released from 1986 to 1991.

Re-issued here as part of the Topic Treasures series – the label’s classic and notable albums expanded in deluxe format with rare images, new liner notes (by folk aficionado/ journalist, Ken Hunt). This 1971 release was Anne Briggs' first full-length album, arriving a long time after she'd become an established figure in the folk revival of the '60s. The material here is split between traditionals and original compositions, some pieces furnished with instrumental backing while others are delivered acappella. The end result is an album that might pose quite a challenge to the casual listener, particularly when it comes to eleven-minute vocal-only narrative 'Little Tambling', which is beautifully sung, but ultimately requires your close attention. When unaccompanied, Briggs' voice takes on a truly haunting quality, sounding quite unlike the earthier intonations of contemporary Shirley Collins, and the fact that for much of the time she's singing incredibly old, hand-me-down laments only heightens the ghostly quality. less"

   "name": "Arvo Pärt has become something of a yardstick by which so much contemporary classical music has been measured, and 'Alina' is arguably his most understated and beautiful piece of work. Für Alina was first performed in Tallinn in 1976, and has become one of Pärt’s most-loved and widely appreciated works - regarded by many as an early, defining example of his signature tintinnabuli style. In the years since its release, Pärt has become the most performed living composer in the world, his approach to religious music seeping deep into our cultural landscape, from the avant garde to the mainstream. Rendered with nothing more than piano and violin, this definitive ECM version from 1999 features Vladimir Spivakov, Sergej Bezrodny, Dietmar Schwalke and Alexander Malter providing alternate versions, handpicked by Pärt himself from recordings that were originally several hours long. It’s a masterclass in simplicity; an almost painfully beautiful rendering of emotional landscapes that, in the wrong hands, could have (and has, on many occasions, by so many) turned to schmaltz. For better or for worse, 'Spiegel Im Spiegel' and 'Fur Alina' have both come to be seen as blueprints for a specific strain of solo piano and classical minimalism designed to manipulate and heighten emotive states, as seen in so many films, adverts and idents. In that respect, one could argue that these pieces are indirectly responsible for numerous heavy-handed, emotionally empty, easy-on-the-ear abominations over the decades. And yet, if you listen carefully, Pärt's ability to distil so much emotion and spirituality into his work from so little is ultimately impossible to emulate; regardless of how many times you've heard them, these pieces never cease to transport you elsewhere. If you're new to Arvo Pärt, Alina is perhaps the perfect entry point for exploring his monumental, peerless canon. less"

The latest in a long and highly collectable line of collaborations released sporadically over the last decade, alongside their work together as NeoTantrik and Slant Azymuth, these two solo mixes, while recorded 1000 miles apart, share a mutually restless spirit and are both riddled with a whole world of cut-up fragments of unknown provenance. Canty’s side was captured in Leeds, 1/2/2019 and is the more oblique, full of insectoid percussions and off key discord, while Votel’s was recorded at Folkteatern, Gothenburg, and invokes a more highly cinematic, worldly feel that most acutely evokes his “fake lore” aesthetic, reducing influences of European science-fiction art, scholastic illustration, post-pop-art, Plakatstil and mid-century graphic design - the same influences that can be seen through his visual work.

   "name": "Phill Niblock's Music For Cello collects three pieces from the 70's and early 80's, performed by cellist David Gibson. Since the late sixties Phill Niblock has been composing long-form acoustic drones with a focus on the rhythms and overtones that rise from closely tuned instruments. His highly original and influential music is an exploration of timbre, microtonality, stability, duration and psychoacoustic phenomenon. \"3 to 7 - 196 is very direct, aggressive, and gritty. The overtone patterns that are produced by the proximal pitches become more prominent with louder volume. So please, play this piece very loud. This was the first piece of mine in which the musician was precisely tuned, in which I chose exact pitches in hertz. We used a sine wave oscillator and frequency counter for the tuning. Descent Plus has four cello tones descending one octave over twenty-two minutes, from 300 hertz to 150 hertz. David Gibson played these tones without lifting his bow from the strings, constantly retuning. I made four different scores, manually changing an oscillator to which he was tuning, for each track's recording. For the revision, we added six more tracks, with David playing long tones which were not descending. The second part of the recording was made nearly twenty years later. Summing II (one of four parts) is mellow and sonorous. David plays two strings simultaneously, one of which is retuned for each successive recording of that pair of tones. This is a mix of an eight track tape. It's better played loud also.\" - Phill Niblock from liner notes less"

   "name": "‘Panopticon Specularities’ is an ambitious and complex feat of avant-classical chamber architecting rooted in Turkish politics and cultural identity, effectively thawing the “frozen music” of the Hagia Sofia’s 1500 year old architecture. It is the bold debut proper by Berlin-based composer Turgut Erçetin for the ever-searching Edition RZ Istanbul native, Turgut Erçetin (1983) studied composition and completed his doctorate studies at Stanford University. His work engages with sound as sonic entities that interact with time and space, with an inherent focus on acoustics and psychoacoustics. He uses computer-aided compositional processes to realise unique impositions of space and place that question notions of physicality and metaphysics: employing a highly technical approach to stage practically impossible soundscapes, bringing the meridian sounds of Istanbul - seagulls, ships horns, street noise, the muezzins’ call-to-prayer - and the uniquely purposed Byzantine architecture of the Hagia Sofia, once a venue for singing, then an Ottoman mosque, and now a museum where music is banned, via the CCRMA facility at Stanford, and into the performance space of a Berlin church. Unable to actually use the Sofia Hagia for recording, Erçetin did the next best thing and modelled its architecture with a computer after gauging its space with sine waves and balloon pops. In the recordings they found the Hagia’s acoustics created specular reflections, localised echoes that highlight specific places, particularly int he 56-metre high dome, which gave the impression of sound descending from above, or from heaven itself. Applying this ancient crafty way of manipulating audience perceptions to the relatively modern idea of F-prisons, smaller cells introduced in Turkey in 2000, as a way of disrupting, segregating prisoners, stymieing their communications, he arrived at the belief that “one could be resilient and free form the solitude to which one is condemned inside and outside, as long as one can move.” The four works in ‘Panopticon Specularities’ bring this idea of freedom of movement within space - and spaces within spaces - to light in remarkable ways that will have ears and eyes wandering across the whole soundsphere, bewildered and rapt. In effect he’s reverse engineering Goethe’s notion of architecture as “frozen music” by using the reaches of technology to “thaw” and make the building’s music liquid again. Directing four spatialized chamber ensembles in the same space, together with pre-recordings in anechoic chambers, to create a complex space of interaction between gendered voices, both human and instrumental, to wonderfully conflate the ideas of the Panopticon - an 18th century British prison design whereby all points are visible from the centre - and public squares where people of all social strata would see and be seen, establishing their identities and social status in the process, in turn revealing the power of freedom of movement. less"

   "name": "A mix of modern noise makers and experts in ancient music put the Italian Futurists’ original Intonarumori instrument thru its paces, while Einstürzende Neubauten’s Blixa barged provides spoken word commentary and history of the instrument and noise “This album contains seven compositions, created by the Opening Performance Orchestra, Blixa Bargeld, Luciano Chessa and Fred Möpert. All the pieces relate to the theme of Futurism and employ intonarumori, instruments invented and used more than a century ago by the Italian Futurists in their noise compositions. The Art of Noises, pertained to the entire 20th century. Published in 1913, in response to Francesco Balilla Pratella's Manifesto of Futurist Musicians, Russolo's text encompassed the fundamental ideas for the new music of the modern age. Radical ideas required original compositional approaches, as well as new types of instruments - hence the Futurists opted for the intonarumori. The two quotations prompted us to give thought to creating compositions in which we would return to the early 20th century, when noises as means of musical expression emerged for the very first time. The typical instruments used by our ensemble, the Opening Performance Orchestra, are laptops, by means of which we conceive our fraction music, which can be briefly characterised by the slogan no melody no rhythm no harmony. Constructing three intonarumori, writing our own pieces for these instruments and performing works by other contemporary composers - Blixa Bargeld, Luciano Chessa and Fred Möpert, represented for us getting into close contact with the beginnings of the musical avant-garde, as well as returning to the historical roots of the music that had served as the basis of noise in art.” less"

With a single exception: it zeroes in on post-80s music. It comprises works of very different kinds by composers of all sorts of backgrounds that, still, can be thought of, as both \"Greeks\" and \"experimentalists\". Experimental electronic music is generally expected to be highly variegated, especially when examined in a breadth of several decades, and with respect to all sorts of artistic, academic, subcultural, and other influences. What is not so obvious, however, is that the very notion of Greekness, as well as its contextual and historical offshoots, are highly diversified, too. This anthology is an attempt to map the various kinds of experimental music that has been produced by Greeks over the last few decades. More, it is also an attempt to delineate different understandings of what \"Greek\" or \"experimental\" may stand for, by means of zeroing in on the numerous, often overlapping, realities and micro-scenes that are associated with the former.” less"

Dilloway’s torment is revealed for our pleasure and disgust in eight parts across the album, following well-trained hunches from the crudely lo-fi budget basement horrors of Ghost and the barbiturate party crank of Karaoke With Cal before the madness really begins to get under the skin with the broken toothed loops and radgy holler of Inhuman Form Reflected, giving way to the heaving, collapsed industrial structure of Born In A Maze. There’s a perfectly unnerving passage of muffled, mumbled croon at the album's epicentre, It’s Not Alright, setting up the listener for a fake left into the low key party ambience of No Eye Sockets (For Otto & Sindy), like you’ve just emerged from a basement bloodbath into a crowd of all-too-normals who don’t know your secret. Scene cuts sharply to what sounds like $&$ trapped in a P-funk K-Hole, with Switch, and the hysteric resolution of Shot Nerves. less"

   "name": "'Space Is Only Noise' is the first album by Nicolas Jaar. By anyones estimations his arrival into the electronic music sphere has been unavoidable, receiving comparisons to Villalobos and AFX from The Guardian, providing one of Resident Advisor's most adventurous mixes to date and practically having Panorama Bar, Fabric and Bar25 eating out of his hands - all before he'd turned 20! His string of releases for the like-minded Wolf+Lamb Music and his own Clown & Sunset label besides remixes for Matthew Dear and Ellen Allien have defined his sound as purposefully slow, sensuous, and with a graceful maturity way beyond his years, all equally informed by HipHop and his Chilean heritage as he is House music and the furthest reaches of electronica. Like the relatively recent pop/dance phenomena of Drag/Witch House, electronic Cumbias and Dubstep, his music signifies a sea change towards exaggerated energy efficiency, dropping the tempo to up the groove and deftly filling the space left behind with supremely sophisticated musical decisions drawing further comparisons to everyone from his beloved Satie and Mulatu Astatke to DJ Shadow. 'Space Is Only Noise' is far from being your conventional House music album and should be filed in your 'promising debut' stack. less"

   "name": "La Casa Tropical keep the kwait-o-meter simmering with P.V.P.’s infectious South African house burners. Both full of balmy, swaying vox and nagging early house riffs and cut at 45rpm for optimal pressure “Patience, Violet ,and Pinky recorded their first Album in 1992. Knowing each other from the music scene, the back up singers turned friends teamed up with Emmanuel Diale and signed with Mob Music to embark on their music career as their own act. The first two albums were straight African Disco, A leftover sound of the 80's that some had still hoped to capitalize on. By the time they released their third album Why O Nketsa so Baby, loosely translated to \"Why are you doing this to me Baby\", Kwaito was still called either Disco or International House, and it was new sound that was taking over. The third album was influenced by the Shangaan sound made largely popular by artists like Penny Penny and Peta Teanet. Looking back now, at the time Mob Music was really leading the pack with this new sound. Being one of the last labels to have official releases with artwork and a group of young talented producers given full creative freedom they pushed the sound in a way only few other labels of that time can be given the same credit. For their fourth and final album on Mob Music they worked with legendary producer/songwriter Malcom \"X\" Makume. With three years of songwriting experience and stellar talent behind the desk the result was the LP Malende. Eight tracks that would combine the early kwaito sound with the more uptempo International House topped off with productions heavily inspired by what had been slowly making its way from Chicago over the last 10 years. At the time they had some success and to this day are well known amongst the real heads. The girls would go on to record one final album once their contract with Mob was up and then after a 5 album catalog would hang up their matching outfits for work a in a newly free South Africa. They remain friends to this day.” less"

   "name": "Listening to this latest album from Liz Harris’ Grouper project it’s easy to forget how much of a hard sell her music was back when 'Way Their Crept’ landed with us back in 2005. Her eerie, layered mix of bare vocals, guitar and tape delay didn't quite fit in with what anyone else was really doing on the scene back then - and it completely knocked us out even if no one was buying it. By the time her breakthrough ‘Dragging a Dead Deer…’ arrived on Type three years later she was more or less playing to a baying mob hungry for any little morsel she cared to throw their way, her (by now) more fleshed out shoegaze variants marking her out as a natural outsider who had managed to tap into some kind of collective melancholy, her songs both hugely affecting and yet somehow emotionally opaque. Last year’s 'The Man Who Died In His Boat’ collected previously unreleased material from the ‘Dead Deer’ era and, despite it essentially being an assembly of offcuts, still managed to sound as coherent and bewitching as any of her ardent followers might have imagined. ‘Ruins’ is Harris' first new album proper in several years and - to no one’s surprise - is just utterly sublime. The opening and closing tracks excepted, Harris’ instrument of choice here is the upright Piano, delivering a sequence of songs that feel utterly bereft and lonely, intended by Harris as “...a document. A nod to that daily walk. Failed structures. Living in the remains of love.” There are also found sounds (you can here a microwave switching itself back on after a powercut in the background), and the room recordings lend an effervescent quality to the recordings that somehow magnify the sense of timelessness. ‘Ruins' is book-ended by two instrumental pieces, the pulsating field recorded opener ‘Made of Metal’ and the 11 minute closer ‘Made of Air’, an instrumental, ambient piece recorded at her mother's house way back in 2004. Together, these tracks make for another sublime 40 minutes spent in Liz Harris’ company, a precious distraction from the clutter and noise of the outside world. less"

   "name": "Another pearl from Freedom To Spend, reissuing the sole, solo side by Japan’s June Chikuma, originally released in 1986, a decade before she wrote the legendary D&B soundtrack for Nintendo’s ‘Bomberman’! Leading on from some of 2018’s finest reissues (by Rimarimba, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Michele Mercure), FTS kicks off 2019 with another insta-favourite in ‘Les Archives’, which repackages June Chikuma’s 1986 LP as Atsushi Chikuma, ’Divertimento’, with bonus material relating to her later work as a composer of classic computer game soundtracks. While there’s seemingly no shortage of material from this era and region in circulation right now, ‘Les Archives’ is more rugged, whacked-out, and singular than most of what the Japanese reissue machine has churned out over the last couple of years. Wielding sampler banks full of YMO and Art of Noise-like percussion, along with glassy syn-flutes, animated synth voices, and the mysterious Michio Toda String Quartet, there’s a singular funk and verve to June’s music that transcends its roots in Tokyo’s City Pop and fusion movements, and hints at the digitised future she would help to literally and subliminally shape via consoles in myriad bedrooms and living rooms across the world. Where Chikuma's computer game soundtracks were necessarily limited by bitrates, here June plays to the full spectrum of mid ’80s hi-fi music, marrying melodic whimsy with a taste for the tang of experimental electronics and a deadly nose for rhythm programming that really sets her apart. We hear those playfully animated rhythms in beguiling effect on the iridescent, polyrhythmic cadence of ‘Broadcast Profanity Delay’, and with lip-bitingly tight fonk swaaang on ‘Pataphysique’ - an excellent word to sum up her approach - whereas ‘Divertimento’ sounds like Art of Noise doing neoclassical, and outta nowhere, ‘Climb-Down’ unfurls as an elegant piece for string quartet. So far, so amazing. But then we factor in the bonus cuts; firstly the charming vignette ‘Mujo to Ifukoto’, a mad little congregation of chamber-esque string sweeps, drums and swannee whistles, while the 7” throws down two angular boogie gems in the drily dubbed-out swerve ‘Oddman Hypotheses’, and pointillist prangs of ‘Dual Use’, which only make this invaluable record even more indispensible. less"

   "name": "Following a sold out run of Salm Vol.1, Arc Light Editions closes the year with a second volume of Gaelic psalm singing. The recordings documented here are from the same psalm singing sessions as the first, and both together represent a complete collection. \"This is music that is transcendent and together, about the individual and the earth, movingly spiritual with or without belief. The sound comes in great waves, swells of sound that break and roll around the space. The texture relies on the individuals: this is group singing where the individual is preserved, elevated, but together. The recordings of Gaelic Psalm singing presented in the release are among the best ever captured. They document a living tradition, a form of religious singing from the Hebrides in Scotland, which is still practiced in Lewis. In Gaelic psalm singing, a precentor leads, and from here voices follow, moving together in great swells like the murmurations of birds. These recordings of Gaelic Psalm singing were originally made over two evenings in the Back Free Church on the Isle of Lewis in October 2003. The singing was spontaneous and totally unrehearsed. The recordings are now presented on vinyl for the first time by Arc Light Editions. A precentor leads off with the first lines of a psalm, and the congregation follows, some faster than others, and each one remains discernible. In his notes to the original release, Calum Martin writes that the form, called precenting (where one person puts out the line and the congregation responds) while not exclusive to Gaelic free church traditions, is in Lewis particularly influenced by the pibroch style of free ornamentation. It’s through this, he says, that the distinctive emotional swell of sound emerges. The sound relies on the congregation’s individual responses to the melody and the individual precentor’s leading. The musical term is free heterophony. Arc Light Editions has worked directly with DR Macdonald at the Bethesda Hospice and Calum Martin on this release, and we thank them for their time. A portion of the profits from this release go directly to Bethesda Hospice, in accordance with the original release.\" less"

   "name": "Kolida Babo is the collaboration between two Greek woodwind musicians from separate regions - Socratis Votskos is from Pella, and Harris P is from Athens. This, their debut album, was recorded in improvised live-take sessions beginning on the night of the “Kolida Babo” folk rituals of music and dance in northern Greece in winter 2013. \"The sessions proceeded over three years, exploring the ancient music of Armenia and the folk traditions of northern Greece’s Epirus and Thrace regions alongside abstract electronics and free jazz. As musicians of modern Greece, the sonic palette is developed in part as a means of processing the country’s immediate actualities: its relation to its regional traditions, its urban centres and its humanitarian and economic crises. In this, the music is at once clearly located in traditional sounds and disjointed from them, at times contrasting or harmonious in both concept and sound. The Armenian Duduk that anchors the project is a double-reeded woodwind instrument made of apricot wood with thousands of years of history and generations of venerable masters - the duo cite Djivan Gasparyan as a main influence, and Harris studied with Vahan Galstyan. Traditionally its music is played in duet: a melody on one duduk, a low drone accompaniment (“the dum”) on another. Kolida Babo preserves and extends the dual nature of duduk music in many ways, replacing the dum at times with the tones of a moog synthesizer to allow the two players to weave harmonies together in duet. And there is a persistent duality in the braid of Kolido Babo’s sonic associations - modern and ancient, local and global - sometimes underpinning one another, sometimes undermining. “Sometimes we mock modern times and sometimes the other way around”, they say - it’s a collision, or an engagement, romantic or pugilistic, and the sense is of an experiment without expectation, without preciousness or exoticism of folk culture. The elements challenge each other and the listener - while the music is very much about texture and tone, the sounds aren’t clearly modern or ancient: it’s futile to identify, we’re reminded, and instead we experience the immediate presence and power of the combination. Influences include Armenian Folk music, Greek Rebetiko, German Kosmiche, Spiritual Jazz, the Fourth World Music of Brian Eno and John Hassell, British Trip Hop, Electrified West African Funk. But where these can be identified they are as sidelong journeymakers through the borderless idiolect belonging to the dialogue between the two players and enabling its free and full execution, subtle markers used to co-ordinate the collaboration.” less"

Ultimately arriving in the latter phase of Bryn Jones (1961-1999) aka Muslimgauze’s oeuvre, ‘Azzazin’ contains some of the project’s most minimal, concentrated gear with he original CD pressed on disc 1 and the corresponding remixes reserved to disc 2. The music is utterly menacing in its stare-down conviction and absolute refusal of practically anything beyond puristic, twisted tones for the first half of the record, with raw, buzzing, and amorphous results perhaps best compared to Mika Vainio at his most intently focussed. Meanwhile the 2nd half of the album sees him keen into more conventional Muslimgauze styles via longer tracts of viscous bass drone and middle eastern percussion flux that give way to gristly distortion and sampled Palestinian voices, nestling - if we’re not mistaken - two spellbinding bonus beats in the vortex that closes side C and a barely-there vignette on side D. less"

   "name": "Wolfgang Voigt’s ambient techno evergreen mercifully reissued as a standalone release for the first time since 1997, and its inclusion in the sumptuous Gas ‘Box’ set, now remastered. Right up there with ambient techno’s greatest slabs, ‘Zauberberg’ is a classic balm for overworked minds and stressed bodies. As the 2nd Gas album, following the project’s eponymous debut, it pressed deeper into a uniquely dense yet diaphanous mixture of ambient and modern classical themes, exploring a breathtakingly lush, Black Forested adjunct to the sort of ambient/dub/techno austerities explored by other contemporary German producers such as Basic Channel, Monolake and the rest of the Berlin cabal surrounding Chain Reaction/Hardwax. As with all GAS releases, It’s possibly difficult to provide any definitive description of ‘Zauberburg’, as we’ve usually fallen under its spell and towards the pillow, or at least drift off into a half-lidded reverie before it finishes. In that sense, we can only limn it from sub- or unconscious recollections, but the two effectively merge into one, as Voigt’s patented, distanced kicks mirror the soft throb of arteries heard muffled in a pillow, and the strings feel to descend with the inevitability of nightfall, all leading to the same conclusion - your head caressed by the sandman. For obsessives fiending a fresh copy, or those lucky noobs about to pop their Gas cherry, this album is 100% essential. less"

   "name": "Geelriandre/Arthesis is named for the pieces that fill its two sides. Geelriandre, realized on an ARP 2500 synthesizer in 1972, featuring Gérard Fremy on prepared piano, for whom the piece was originally composed. Arthesis, realized using the University of Iowa's Moog in 1973, comprises the full duration of side B. The first of the two half-hour pieces 'Geelriandre' was made on an ARP Synthesizer in 1972 accompanied by Gérard Fremy on Piano, and finally recorded at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, December 1979. In its 29 minute life-span the world seems to gradually slow down spinning on its axis, everything feels measured to a deeply attuned internal clock. The ARP provides layers of wavering tones which gradually accumulate, dissipate and re-emerge with a subliminal quality while sensitively struck percussion - gongs and other, sharper metallic objects - mark out time with a saintly, opiated patience. Then there's 'Arthesis' - realised on the Moog Synthesizer at the University of Iowa in 1973, a track which makes you feel like part of your consciousness is folding back into itself. A low, low hum starts out in the left channel before overtones gradually bleed into the right ending with a moebius strip-like circuit. After another 15 minutes or so both channels appear to start swooning in a kind of elliptical syncopation, leaving you utterly transfixed and dazed by the end. Hearing these pieces now, in our over-saturated soundsphere, the effect is nothing short of radical and deeply, unforgettably affective. If you're seeking something literally extra-ordinary, which seems to displace time altogether, these pieces will greatly enrich your mind.

   "name": "Finally, Roland Kayn’s breathtaking cybernetic salvo, ’Simultan’; one of the most important works by one of the 20th century's greatest (if unsung) composers; all newly remastered from original tapes and reissued for the first time since the original 1977 release by classical music label, Colosseum. Huge Recommendation for followers of work by Jaap Vink, Leo Küpper, Jim O’Rourke, Keith Fullerton-Whitman, Autechre, The Hafler Trio... Italy’s Die Schachtel, following the lead of Frozen Reeds’ and their 16CD edition of ‘A Little Milky Way of Sound’ in 2017, have the honour of reintroducing ’Simultan’ into the wild. Presented to the highest possible standards on the format it was intended for, the unfeasibly complex dynamics and revelatory perceptive spaces opened up inside ’Simultan’ are bound to generate jaw-dropping reactions with Kayn's growing ranks of followers and even the most hard-to-please fans of outer-limit composition. Collapsing ideas from electro-acoustic, concrète, electronic, and computer music disciplines into what he termed “cybernetic music”, Kayn methodically and effectively worked off-the-radar towards a form of Artificial Intelligence in music from 1962 until his death in 2011. Building on his earlier studies with seminal figures such as Boris Blacher and Oskar Sala (whose FX appeared on classic Hitchcock’s), as well as time spent playing organ and piano with Ennio Morricone and Egisto Macchi’s exploratory Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza, Kayn devoted his life’s work toward realising what would become recognised among the most incredible, genuinely prism-pushing arrangements of sound ever recorded. ’Simultan’ is the first in a series of seminal Roland Kayn boxsets released between 1977 and his blinding masterpiece ’Tektra’ in 1984. While he had previously contributed ‘Cybernetics III’ to a Deutsche Grammofon split with Luigi Nono, ’Simultan’ was where Kayn’s ideas really came to fruition, and with results that practically document the birth of a new music, or a computer manifesting its first signs of sentience in sound. Weighing in at six pieces clocking in at over two hours, it’s arguably a difficult, spasmodic birth when compared with the smoother contours and expansive arrangements of his subsequent releases, but that amorphous atonality and noisy unpredictability accounts for much of the attraction to ’Simultan’, which sounds like very little before it, or even since. If you’re the insatiably curious, technically pedantic type, then many of your queries about Kayn’s music will be answered in the lucubrate liner notes included on the insert, which provide all the technical context one would need to know. But it’s better to just dive head-first into ’Simultan’ and let your head be consumed, dissolved into those micro-organismic diffusions and unfathomable chaos. Mercifully this 2nd wind will prevail on further reissues of Kayn’s aforementioned run of boxsets up to and including ‘Tektra’. We advise making some space on your shelves and your calendar to spend some time with this incredible music. less"

   "name": "Compiling the last 3 albums in the 'Everywhere At The End Of Time' series - 6 x LP’s and almost 5 hours of material cataloguing the ultimate descent into dementia and oblivion, using a patented prism of sound to connote a final, irreversible transition into the haunted ballroom of the mind that he first stepped into with 1999’s ‘Selected Memories From the Haunted Ballroom’. Invoking Jack Nicolson’s caretaker character in Stanley Kubrick/Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’ as metaphor for issues revolving around mental health and a growing dissociation/dissatisfaction with the world, the project really took on new dimensions in 2005 with the 72-track, 6CD boxset ‘Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia’, which was accompanied by an insightful unpacking of its ideas by cultural critic Mark Fisher aka K-Punk; a stalwart of the project who identified it (alongside music from Burial and Broadcast) among the most vital, emergent works of Hauntological art - a form of music often preoccupied with ideas about memory and nostalgia (but one distinct from pastiche), and the way that they possibly overwhelm, occlude, or even define our sense of being; ideas that resonate with Fisher’s own assertion that capitalism essentially undermines collective thought, distorts the individual, and has tragically lead to a worldwide increase or even ubiquity of mental health-related issues. By using fusty samples from an obsolete analog format, and by doing so in the 2nd decade of the 2nd millennium, The Caretaker perfectly and perversely bent ideas of anticipation/expectation with his arrangements, playing with notions of convention and repetition with effect that would lead some listeners to wonder if the same record was being released over and again. When combined with Ivan Seal’s bespoke painting for each release from 2011’s ‘An Empty Bliss Beyond This World’ onwards, the project crystallised as a real gesamtkunstwerk for these times, and one arguably defined by a stubborn and intractably chronic drive against the grain of modern popular culture, or even a refusal of it. And so to the project’s final goodbye. Drifting from the silty departure of ‘Confusion so thick you forget forgetting’, thru the smudged anaesthetisation of ‘A brutal bliss beyond this empty defeat’, and the abyssal, distant echoes of ‘Long decline is over’, to the increased pauses that punctuate the final side’s piece, ‘Place in the World fades away’, it eventually leads to a final coda that breaks the fourth wall. Here, with the outside world muted and only the timbral residue remaining like smoke, everything moves as slow as a Lynchian dream sequence - until a conclusion so ineffably sublime occurs that we can’t mention it for fear of waking up. At this point it’s also perhaps worth pointing out the uncannily profound synchronicity between the timelines of ‘Everywhere At The End of Time’ and Brexit, which both started in 2016 and are due to wrap up in spring 2019. It should be no stretch of the imagination to read into their parallel progression from nostalgia and historic/collective amnesia, to progressive dementia and complete obliteration of (the) sense(s). less"

Embarking on the Caretaker’s final journey with the familiar vernacular of abraded shellac 78s and their ghostly waltzes to emulate the entropic effect of a mind becoming detached from everyone else’s sense of reality and coming to terms with their own, altered, and ever more elusive sense of ontology. The series aims to enlighten our understanding of dementia by breaking it down into a series of stages that provide a haunting guide to its progression, deterioration and disintegration and the way that people experience it according to a range of impending factors. In other words, Everywhere At The End of Time probes some of the most important questions about modern music’s place in a world that’s increasingly haunted or even choked by the tightening noose of feedback loops of influence; perceptibly questioning the value of old memories as opposed to the creation of new ones, and, likewise the fidelity of those musical memories which remain, and whether we can properly recollect them from the mire of our faulty memory banks without the luxury of choice less"

Better still for those who know, the four bonus tracks from 1990 demonstrate just how quickly styles moved on back then, as the BPMs and production detail ramp in intensity, following the feedback loop of ravers and producers pushing themselves to darker, hardcore ecstasies. Seriously this is quite the reissue. We would be chuffed enough with the newly remastered versions of Lhasa’s Dr. Strangelove-sampling New Beat hunch, ‘Acetabularia’ and its Detroit-skooled sibling ‘Acetatechno’, but the bonuses just send it into orbit, reeling from the epic, lip-smacking Goa trance velocity of of ‘Into The Desert’, to the strobe lit rave-techno pressure of ‘Gather Like Dust’ and the sexier movement of ‘Premonition’ and the Derrick May/B12-esque beauty ‘The Call’.

Where Nihiloxica’s first tape saw the Nilotika Cultural Ensemble percussionists and UK’s Jacob Maskell-Key and Pete Jones tentatively find their feet in a nascent mix of Bugandan drumming and raw electronics, this follow-up throws down four muscular tracks recorded live in single takes, demonstrating their skills toughened up by countless shows on road over the past 12 months and more; from Nyege Nyege Tapes amazing annual festival and clubs in Kampala, thru to stacks of European venues. In the four burningly intense tracks of ‘Biiri’, the group’s cross-cultural dialogue becomes more fluid, urgent as a direct effect of their increased intuition. The results vividly feel like a natural evolution of their first release, with their keener focus on the loping undulations of the Baksimba (bass drum) groove and the plasmic mutability of Pete Jones’ synths rendering the full force of ancient tradition in a vividly unprecedented style. While many pay service to the idea of a cosmic African music, ‘Biiri’ delivers it with effortless verve, coming off like Can and Bruce Haack’s wildest dreams with ‘Diggi Dagga’, then like Autechre meeting Shackleton in the swingeing, asymmetric rug-cutter ‘Baksimba’, before the thumping ‘Dubugwanjuba’ recalls a cross-continental echo of Mark Ernestus’ Ndagga Rhythm Force, and ‘Ding Ding’ utterly finishes off your dancing bones with raucous, red-lining distortion. less"

It’s shiny and smiley on the surface, but with a gritted teeth/teeth-gritting effect under the surface - highly recommended if yr into Kim Hiorthoy, Tunng, Múm... ‘Joyrobix’ is Brummy-abroad Joe Snape’s flooring return to Slip: a songbook of nimble, aching pop that wrings raggedy solace from dejection and displacement. Begun as a danceable refix of pieces for chamber ensemble toured the last three years, production on ‘Joyrobix’ stalled sharply in 2016. Instead of a self-confident exercise in documentation, the record twisted into a darker, more lyrical original: a period portrait of dislocation and burnout following Snape’s move to the US in 2015. There’s still plenty of fun to be had. Between the adult contemporary guitars, gospel grooves, and Broadway melisma, the tropes of a musical America are present, correct, and indefatigably uptempo.

   "name": "Montreal cellist and composer Justin Wright makes a memorable first impression with debut solo suite ‘Music For Staying Warm’, playing to the full spectrum of his sound ranging from improvisations to “drone” works and more “composed” pieces, all tied by a sensitive and calming soulful touch. Recorded with a quartet of violin, viola, cello and double bass in the Rocky Mountains, and cinematically sounds like it “\"Music For Staying Warm began when I was tasked with writing and performing a set of string works for a relaxation room at a chaotic all-night event in the heart of Montreal winter. It was a cold winter, and for me, a cold year, and when a cat curled up at my feet in the middle of performing these works, I felt like I was doing something right. After gradually developing these ideas many months after the first performances, I recorded most of this album during a residency at the Banff centre for the Arts, coinciding with a surprise visit from my long-time collaborator Kate Maloney. What all of these tracks have in common, aside from being limited to string instruments, is an intention for you to relinquish your sense of anticipation. Conceptually, they were heavily inspired by particular styles of Ethiopian music such as the tizita, which often lacks any resolving cadences to leave you with it’s trademark evocation of longing without resolution. So I guess there is a certain amount of irony in the name Music for Staying Warm. Drone III definitely isn’t warm. But refuge is just as often acceptance of where you are as it is an escape, and I hope that, whatever I was thinking when I wrote this music, you are able to contextualise it in your own life and find your own meaning.\" less"

The diggin’ liveliness of Grup Ses is well present in the samples used, manufacturing beats that serve well the fast paced and nocturnal voice of Ethnique Punch. The first part of “Deli Divan” is pretty much a straight story. A good one. But then comes the surprise. The other side. The same fourteen tracks without voice, just the beats. And here “Deli Divan” tells a completely different story. It loses the emergency, darkness and robustness of the A side, specially because the beats float on a limbo without a voice. But that limbo reveals the straightforwardness of the beats created by Grup Ses for this record. There’s a hidden narrative here, without the voice the short tracks connect like an outer world radio broadcast. But there’s no narrator. Just time-travelling beats that interlink past, present and future, synthetizing complex ideas in short bursts of 1 or 2 minutes. Delight it is.” less"

Following this slow, mazy logic, the two parts of ‘The Roamer’ see us out in low key, shadowy style with thicc subs and stealthy, noirish gestures worthy of Bohren Und Der Club of Gore or Portishead in the first part precipitating a deliciously glassy, sparse closer recalling moments of Diego Herera’s ace SK U Kno LP.

Originally released in 1981 as a limited vinyl pressing of 300 copies on Agi Yuzuru’s fabled experimental label Vanity Records (R.N.A. Organism, Dada, Sympathy Nervous, Tolerance…), Lady Maid is a testament to the creativity of the early 80s’ Japanese electronic and experimental scene, encapsulating a prolific era when audio gear became affordable for musicians to explore sounds in the comfort of their home, free from studio time pressure and major label rules. Entirely imagined and brought to life by an inspired Yukio Fujimoto, the 6-track opus was conceived with a Korg MS-20, a Korg SQ-10, a Boss Dr. Rhythm DR-55, and…a Texas Instruments Speak & Spell! It’s elegantly minimalist, honest and witty, very playful, cleverly pop, and downright fascinating. The a-side captures the fun side of avant-garde electronica, lo-fi wave, proto-glitch, and IDM, a joyful ride beautifully interrupted by the cinematic mood switch of the b-side - a 20 minute ambient piece flirting with sci-fi, melancholy, and hints of metallic darkness.

   "name": "One of this century’s first true modern classics, this 2004 album from Supersilent member and experimental shakuhachi-style trumpet player Arve Henriksen has long been a reference points for Jazz music of the most quietly absorbing variety, containing what must surely rank as one of the most beautiful opening tracks of any album in recent memory... We’re not sure what took them so long, but Rune Grammofon finally get around to pressing Arve Henriksen’s Chiaroscuro [2004] on wax, rendering its sublime, otherworldly, etheric appeal on the format most befitting of its classic status. Replete with the breathtaking Opening Image and that beautiful cover art now blown up to 12”x 12”, this gorgeous record is quietly awaiting a slot in any and all collections of contemporary ambient, classical composition. Originally released on CD as the second solo album by virtuoso Norwegian trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist, Henriksen - who was by then already esteemed on the jazz and classical circuit and for his work with the Supersilent ensemble alongside Helge Sten (Deathprod, who also mastered this LP) - this album deeply perfused and coloured the listening lives of ourselves and many, many others with an enchanted breeze of flyaway vocals, trumpet and percussion diffused with a sublime butterfly effect of electro-acoustic process. \"Chiaroscuro\" (\"light and shade\") is quite an unbelievable listen - cinematic in a way that defies pastiche, a vast panoramic ocean of sound reduced to the most silent, heart-wrenching string arrangements, samples (courtesy of Jan Bang) and a whispered sweep of barely audible percussion (from Audun Kleive), hovering around Henriksen unique, mesmerising trumpet playing and broken voice. Its incredibly gentle, diaphanous arrangements would, pretty understandably, end up licensed for TV and film, which is where many would have osmotically absorbed the likes of Opening Image without having a clue who made it. For us, it was a staple in our old shop, Pelicanneck [1998-2007] and therefore instantly redolent of the smell of fresh coffee and waffles and Carol Batton poetry. Over ten years later it still has that faintly nostalgic effect, but more in the comforting way of a ubiquitous classic which, no matter your exposure to it, will always hold a special place in your heart.

Unfolding through a 40 minute synthesiser suite in four parts, 'Circular Forms' is one of the most captivating examples of Mogard's deeply evocative music, drawing out a sort of direct emotional quality from his limited set-up of Farfisa organs and a self-built modular system. At this point his backstory bears repeating: Mogard worked in a Serbian factory for most of his life, and upon retirement began making synth music to remind him the harmonic buzz and drone of heavy machinery. Between 2012 - 2013 he issued his first works on tape thru Steve Moore's VCO Records, followed most recently by a gorgeous split vinyl for Emotional Response. But this one for Ecstatic is our favourite yet, framing three misty-eyed visions with perfectly suited titles such as 'Slate-Coloured Storm' and 'Half Light of Dawn' on the front, backed with the 16 minutes of slow and tortuous valerian bliss of 'House of the River' on the back.

The seamlessly sequenced 44 minute work reminds us the pure pleasure of locking in and staying there, recalling a time before dancefloor patterns were disrupted by health & safety, when a couple of garys and a pack of tabs would see you right for 6 hours spent in the control of a single DJ who could work you like a marionette. This isn’t a DJ set, but it works very much like the ideal of a fluid deep techno selection, stealthily layering and introducing new motifs that form and recede around a rolling 4/4 ballast, incrementally and almost imperceptibly shifting gears to conserve energy and motion. Like an intangible scent or motif that jogs the memory, ‘Throw Light Upon’ subliminally gets inside the head and under the skin to remind of pure, classic techno from Plastikman, Mika Vainio’s Ø, Donato Dozzy, Nuel. less"

If you were into Haswell & Hecker’s amazing ‘Blackest Ever Black (Electroacoustic UPIC Recordings), or generally fascinated by PAN's sprawling, multi-faceted interests, this incredible album really is a kind of encapsulation of that limitless world of sound... Amnesia Scanner, Bill Kouligas and Harm Van Dorpel’s prism-collapsing, algorithmic A/V project ‘Lexachast’ becomes extruded polyvinyl flesh on their sickeningly strong debut for PAN. Conceived in 2015 as an improvised performance between Bill Kouligas and Amnesia Scanner at London’s ICA, ‘Lexachast’ was subsequently developed into an online A/V work with visual artist Harm Van Dorpel, and is here presented in its current, full-grown form - a flux of sonic references to the fallout of avant-EDM and cyberdrone, resembling a swan dive into the uncanny valley’s darkside. In a bold synaesthetic dialogue, Kouligas and Amnesia Scanner sonically respond to a dense flux of NSFW and extremely banal images raked up from the Internet’s underbelly (Deviant Art and Flickr) and layered by Harm Van Dorpel’s ever-evolving, image-sourcing algorithm. Through this process, they effectively give voice to the images and their morphed meanings, mirroring their abstracted, warped content with a sonic vocabulary of hypermodern dance musick. The results speak to humanity’s ever-changing relationship and un/familiarity with the Internet, and the way it mediates the self. Simultaneously drawing upon our darkest thoughts, our existential traumas and their prosaic settings, Lexachast is acutely symptomatic of our epoch - taking age old concerns about who we are and the limits of new technology. It’s not pretty, but it is utterly fascinating - like a car crash witnessed in slow motion. less"

She re-recorded the song and self-released it as part of new edition, which the marvellous Constellation have now picked up for this reissue, some 33 tours later Combining her knowledge of traditional Abenaki songs, learnt in her home community of Odanak, with lyrics in french and english, and more modernist arrangements drawing from jazz and classical, Bush Lady paints an engrossing and unforgettable portrait of the venerable singer, songwriter, and storyteller which has somehow managed to evade the attentions of reissuers until now. The 2-part, 13 minute long opener Bush Lady, Pt.1 + II make a transfixing introduction with Alanis’ mix of traditional and modern vocals dancing free over a tumpin’ drum and expanded with searching fiddle that beautifully tails off with her vocals in the 2nd part.

RIYL Alessandro Cortini, The Caretaker, Fennesz, Tangerine Dream, Brain Eno, Tim Hecker... Abul Mogard’s relatively unusual path to releasing music is well documented, but bears repeating here. Upon taking retirement from a job at a factory which he held for decades, Mogard craved the mechanical noise and complex harmonics of the industrial workplace, and found that the best way to fulfil that need was through electronic music - using a limited set-up of Farfisa organs, voices, samplers and a self-built modular system to realise a peaceful yet haunting, sweetly coruscating sound that resonates uncommonly with music from Leyland Kirby to Alessandro Cortini, or Fennesz and Tim Hecker. The nine tracks on Works are soused in an emotional richness that’s hard to forget once experienced. Broad daubs of distorted bass and naturally glorious harmonic progressions paint panoramas of wide open, grey-scaled skies whilst equally conveying the intimate feel of a person with their nose to the machine, toiling for a sound or feeling that really means something to them, and by turns, us. The fact that Mogard hails from an area hardly well-known for its synth music, and that he’s of an age where most people take up gardening or lawn bowls, rather than synth music, only helps to aid the enigma and magick surrounding this remarkable artist and his layered, emotional music. less"

This remastered collection casts an ear over what Orleans might call the ‘pop sensibility’ within her back catalogue. Released previously on a number of small DIY labels, Orleans’ music coincided with the explosion of auto-didactic musicians finding their voice in the age of the blogosphere, artists emboldened by the democratisation of music-making afforded by the internet. From the outset, Orleans’ childhood studying formal music mixed with cut-up techniques, sampling, sound-art and experimentation to create a distinctive signature cloaked in an innate melancholy and playfulness. Fully remastered by James Plotkin, featuring extensive sleeve-notes and rare photos from Orleans’ archive, Movies For Ears presents an appraisal of the musician’s work, painting a portrait of an artist with an uncanny ability to evoke emotions and ghosts of memories in the listener.” less"

   "name": "Dungeon Acid injects psychedelic vapours into steely Detroit-inspired acid/techno on his long awaited debut album proper, recorded and edited between 2010-2019 for his pals and admirers at Ideal Recordings. RIYL Underground Resistance / Börft! Dungeon Acid has become the most vital of drummer and producer Jean-Louis Huhta’s many projects, following a musical arc since the ‘80s which has seen him variously play with crust punk group Anti Cimex (and tour the UK alongside Napalm Death in a van with no seats), become a member of cult Swedish rave band Lucky People Centre, play ritual rock tribalism with The Skull Defekts, and duel with electro-acoustic heavyweights such as Zbigniew Karkowski and CM Von Hausswolff. Yet for all his stylistic versatility, Huhta’s heart has consistently been found in tough, driving and psychedelic strains of house and techno indebted to Detroit since the ‘90s - eventually ending up on Detroit’s influential FIT sound imprint last year. This inspiration comes out in unexpected ways across his first Dungeon Acid album proper; working within this square but malleable meter via persistently detailed tweaks and hypnotically layered productions, where he’s unafraid to push into the red or lower the tempo and croon like a shaman conducting ancient rites. In 9 parts he effectively joins the dots between the psychy, punkish dance trax of Börft Records and the Motor City mechanics of Underground Resistance, generating a singular, machine-borne but organic flow with big highlights between jelly-limbed acid opening, through to steely warehouse hammers, a slow and skudgy hymn to nose drip dynamics, and two belting barrels of warped Biker Bar funk that would surely make the grade in the 313 any time between the early ‘90s and now. Dungeon Acid is brilliant testament to the art of marrying mutually exclusive bedfellows as much as it is a masterclass in dare-to-be-different house and techno, all done with hard-won skills, natural personality and warmth, with history and future at the front of the mind. less"

   "name": "Philip Glass’ previously unreleased, 1975 performance of ‘Music In Twelve Parts’ is the latest archival excavation on Paris-based Transversales Disques, the label run by the GRM’s Jonathan Fitoussi. Performed by Philip Glass with Jon Gibson, Dickie Landry, Michael Riesman, Joan La Barbera and Richard Peck, it's one of the earliest iterations of ‘Music In Twelve Parts’, which would be fully issued the following year, 1976, to become one of Glass’ best known and loved works. Placing the previously issued Parts 1 & 2 on side A, the never-before released parts 11, 3, and 12 are cut to sides B & C, finding the piece reeling off into breathtaking chromatic dervishes and ecstatic minimalism with a truly head-spinning lushness, especially in the stunning murmurations of Part 12. Side D is effectively a piece in its own right. Recorded for french radio by Daniel Caux - musicologist and co-founder of Shandar Records - Glass speaks in french over recordings of the rehearsals for ‘Music In Twelve Parts’, held in his NYC loft. Together with the scream of sirens, it gives some fascinating context for the piece (even if you don’t parlez francais) as it inherently highlights link between the colours of the sirens and the music which we may not have gauged otherwise. less"

The song pouring over the devastated womb. For those who have left it. Premonition of renunciation of the oppressive cycle. Tiredness of the devastation. Wanting infertility as well as wanting a husband is equal to his death inside her — the final one. Mother remembers the receptacle, and with it the mountain of the perished. She will search for the firstborn among the piles of bones and, without distinguishing order, will interrupt the expulsion.

   "name": "Stunning, previously unheard chapter in the saga of Igor Wakhevitch, a close peer and associate of everyone from Pierre Henry to Yves Saint-Laurent and Pink Floyd, one of the first composers of his generation to make use of Moog, Synthi AKS and ARP synthesizers. responsible for some of the most remarkable synth music known to humankind. Among the key, pioneering ‘70s artists who brought an epic sense of poetry to the language of avant-garde synth and concrete music which emerged in the ‘60s, Wakhevitch is hailed as a cult figure for his string of classic albums including ‘Logos’, ‘Docteur Faust’, and ‘Let’s Start’ between 1970-1979, as well as production for Terry Riley, and on Salvador Dalí’s opera, ‘Être Dieu’ (‘To Be God’). Most beautifully, he opened up synth music’s 3rd eye to heavy inspiration from Hindu classical music and schools of thought, leading him to spend 30 years in India prior to the construction of this, a masterful chapter in his visionary canon. ‘Kshatyra [The Eye of the Bird]’ is a remarkable, much later work, recorded in the late 90’s on Wakhevitch’s custom Mysterious Island 88 system, and later edited for this release last year. It came to Wakhevitch as a means of mediating and reconciling his ontology (the grandson to victims of the Shoah) and his knowledge of Hindu symbolism, making use of ancient Indian classical modes and the Far Eastern-influenced styles of Jean Claude-Eloy, consistently conjuring heady modes of listening, hypnotic and transcendent, that subliminally yet potently light up the subconscious. In eight parts he navigates a journey from celestial melody through spirit-engulfing, widescreen black hole synth dimensions and glistening visions of the sublime, before seeming to collapse the firmament into the earth and vice-versa in the chapter’s glorious, durational finale brimming with elegiac church bells, sky-scorching synths and deep abstractions. Long a cult figure to diggers and listeners in the know, the praise and admiration for Wakhevitch’s music (by everyone from Demdike Stare to Andy Votel and the GRM’s Jonathan Fitoussi) is proportionally inverse to the availability of his music, which remains all too hard to come by. This new album is crucial as a portal to worlds unheard, and a startling introduction for many to one of the most quietly important figures in electronic music. less"

Wheras it's predecessor was composed over a staggered period of many, many years, this album was fashioned in a fraction of that time, lending a tangible symmetry between these shapeshifting tracks that's as loose as it is detached from the rest of the modern herd. Of the 14 tracks he's selected, we've previously encountered the first two, with the unstable space float of 'Hubble' appearing on a shady Thriller 12\" and his remix of Various Production's 'Lost' reminding us how good his most overlooked cuts can be. From here in it's all about that next-level longing, sealing the airlock and initiating pressure sequence with 'Futureproofing', before laying down the robo-boogie with 'Always Human'. Showing a teflon resistance towards easy categorisation, 'Get Ohn (Fairlight Mix)' swerves down a side street into a footwurkin' face-off by cyborgs sliding to a mutilated mix of Jon E Cash and Chez Damier played underwater. Next we hit the erogenous interzone of 'Maze' and that incapacitatingly lush bassline designed to lock into your central nervous system and send shockwaves of piloerection to every f*cking corner of your soul. After that, we're cynically dumped into the Ferraro-esque Prince tribute 'Purple Splazsh', and on into the Detroit ghetto stalk of 'Let's Fly'. The dissonant robo-crunk of 'The Kettle Men' and closing entry 'Casanova' confirm that if anything, Actress is only suffering from a surfeit of ideas and expanded technical expertise. Proof, if it were needed, that there is a sprawling future beyond the stasis of so much contemporary electronic music. less"

   "name": "Craig Tattersall unspools a gorgeous new tape of disintegrated piano meditations and dusty lower case ephemera for Belgium’s Dauw label. It’s been over 4 years since we last heard from him and over 20 since we were first introduced to Tattersall’s uniquely brittle productions, first as part of Hood and The Remote Viewer, and subsequently as one half of The Boats and at the helm of the hugely loved Cotton Goods series. Despite being a constant presence around us throughout these last two decades, this just might be the most delicate, beautiful music we’ve heard from Tattersall to date. ‘things are sweeter when they’re lost’ is a fittingly melancholy notion for the music inside. On the A-side it’s a dreamily searching, silty flux of piano notes peeling in slow motion. Strings drift over, connoting cold breezes and infrasonic, spectral presences, but the effect is far from menacing, it’s more a tranquil shade of sublime, like those hours after midnight when the meridian sounds of road traffic and human life have ebbed off into the distance and you’re left with the sighing creaks of a room. The sound is remarkably different on the B-side. Here the air gradually thickens with murkier sub-harmonic distortion, bordering on a seething sense of aggression relative to most of Tattersall’s other output, pushing the grim murk to a logical entropy that precipitates elegiac pauses for reflection and warbling closure. There are so, so many operators out there who’ve clearly tried to divine the same atmosphere and mindset, but Tattersall has somehow always struck a different, more authentic note for us. He evokes the memory of some distant, formative music suspended in time and outlined in vague, half-remembered shapes, filled with love. less"

   "name": "The fluidity of the phrasing, timbral research, complex rhythmic combinations and rare sense of improvisation make this one of the best modern jazz recordings on the Saravah label in the 1970s. \"The cello, although considered a minority instrument in the history of jazz and improvisation, has carved itself a niche, both in the USA (Fred Katz, Calo Scott, Abdul Wadud, Diedre Murray, Peggy Lee) and in Europe (Tristan Honsinger, Maarten Altena, Denis Van Hecke, Ernst Reijseger). Alongside Didier Petit, Jean-Charles Capon is one of the French virtuosi on the instrument, that he began playing professionally at the beginning of the 60s before creating the Baroque Jazz Trio. His name was rapidly linked to different cult groups for who he became the guest star (Confluence, Perception, Speed Limit), but also with many more or less well-known (free) jazz musicians including David S. Ware (with whom he recorded the impeccable duo From Silence To Music), Philippe Maté, Michel Roques, André Jaume or Joe McPhee (as part of Po Music). Jef Gilson helped get his career under way (they recorded together as far back as 1968) before Pierre Barouh, boss of Saravah records with who Jean-Charles Capon played alongside Brigitte Fontaine and Areski, offered him the opportunity to record his first album: L'Univers-solitude. In the company of Swiss percussionist Pierre Favre, Jean-Charles Capon demonstrated, in all registers, a level of invention way beyond a traditional rhythmic and melodic background, with the fluid phrasing a perfect complement to his extended range. It is not for nothing that Jean-Charles Capon admires Duke Ellington, John Lewis and Gabriel Fauré, as can be heard on his later highly personal versions of \"Mood Indigo\", \"Django\" and \"Après un rêve\". As for Pierre Favre, he is not there just to make up the numbers: his timbral research and combinations of complex rhythms offer the French cellist wonderful interaction throughout this remarkable album which had finally been given a dignified rerelease.\" less"

   "name": "Following the reissue of Robert Ashley’s ‘Private Parts’ last week, a reanimated Lovely Music serve this absolute pearl from David Behrman, an important and beautiful artefact of interactive computer music recorded in 1977 and featuring a primitive microcomputer manipulating and evolving improvised acoustic parts for flute, bassoon and cello. It was conceived and recorded in parallel to the arrival of the first home computers, and is one of the earliest, most subtle and satisfying examples of machine language interacting with acoustic instrumentation we’ve heard. \"On the Other Ocean” was recorded in 1977 at the influential Mills College and features Maggi Payne on flute, Arthur Stidfole on bassoon and David Behrman on electronics, feeding their improvisations into the Kim-1 microcomputer for \"Harmonic Responses” - or a kind of primitive machine learning. As the label explain: \"The relationship between the two musicians and the computer is an interactive one, with the computer changing the electronically-produced harmonies in response to what the musicians play, and the musicians influenced in their improvising by what the computer does.\" Behrman expands: \"When we went into the Mills recording studio that sunny September afternoon with the breeze blowing through the Golden Gate, we had had no previous rehearsal; Maggi Payne and Arthur Stidfole had never performed together; the simple software (typed laboriously by hand in machine language into the tiny hexadecimal keypad of the \"Kim 1\" microcomputer) had just been completed. I had no idea what would happen. When Maggi and Arthur began spinning off their long, calm phrases I remember being surprised. And I remember catching an expression of what looked like surprise on the countenance of \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny through the control room window. We did two takes, chose one and that was it.\" \"Figure in a Clearing” followed a similar process, but this time the main player was cellist David Gibson, once again feeding into the Kim-1. Behrman explains: \"It seemed astounding in 1977 that a translucent green circuit board with a tiny brain on it could take a million instructions per second from its little memory and send commands to another device (the home-made music synthesizer) whenever its program asked it to do so. David Gibson's only \"score\" was a list of 6 pitches to be used in performance, and a request that he not speed up when the computer-controlled rhythm did. The timbral richness and concentrated eloquence of his playing sprang from his own sources.” Listening to this edition over 40 years later, the thing that’s perhaps most striking about these recordings is their subtlety; where you’d perhaps expect to find heavy-handed utilisation of new technology, instead you discover slowly evolving, gently mutating pieces hiding a multitude of processes. Behrman’s work here is so startling in its beauty and subtlety that it should be used as a textbook guide for how to approach innovative technology; with patience, restraint and consideration. Huge recommendation. less"

In an age full of exhausting noise, chaos and unconscious verbalism, Mary Lattimore and Mac McCaughan’s “New Rain Duets” offers an antidote. \"Diaphanous melody emerges from the strings of Lattimores harp, at times reminiscent of a room full of antique music boxes playing different songs but in accord. The synthesizer textures from McCaughan float in and around the harps arpeggios, warm like cloud cover, then disturbed and more harshly electronic. Like the textures on Bowie’s Berlin albums with Eno, there is a constant sense of beauty and foreboding coexistent. The collaboration’s four movements snake and float through a liminal sonic universe, without a linear sense of tension/release but rather a calm and brooding build into a widening pool of immersive sound. “New Rain Duets” proves that “cosmic music” lives not just in the notes played but also the ones in between.

Whether weaving nods to Alice Coltrane with funereal torch song in Killing Time, or sounding like gothic Trentemøller doing clattery, jazzed-up D&B on The Governor, and even smoky ’50s doo-wop mixed with desiccated rocksteady groove in History Lesson, whose title is perhaps the earnest key to Sirens, Jaar’s 2nd album is slightly trickier to date than its predecessor, yet detectable nostalgic for another time and place. We’re most attracted to its quieter moments, as with the ether drift of Leaves and its gauzy smudge of brass, strings and pads infiltrated with what we’ll assume is a sample of Nico as a child babbling to his famous father, making for a nice, innocent contrast with the rest of his earnest, pleading croons. less"

   "name": "‘United’ is the incredible, ambiguous solo debut of medieval and electronic music hybrids by classically trained viola player Annie Garlid as UCC Harlo. To us it sounds like a baroque take on Arthur Russell's 'World Of Echo' treated with choral riffs. One of the most striking debuts we've heard recently, ‘United’ introduces a patently gifted composer blossoming after many years playing on other people’s records, from early music ensembles to contemporaries such as Bill Kouligas, Caterina Barbieri and Holly Herndon. In her first solo LP Garlid reconciles these opposing poles of her work without making any concessions to her art, rendering a stellar set that ties up medieval baroque, deconstructed dance music, vaulted kosmische and hauntological ambient-pop in a measured, stately and quietly breathtaking style. Recorded over six years in Germany, the album started as sketches made during train commutes to work in a Cologne orchestra, and was later finished in Berlin. Across its 8 tracks, Garlid weaves complex contexts into beautifully refined compositions with a preternatural patience and timeless grace that’s anything but difficult to grasp for listeners with little to no knowledge of early and classical music modes. It’s rare to hear such a diverse yet coherent collection executed quite like ‘United’. From the opening swell of viola, mixed with trickling field recordings, synth, and Garlid’s etheric vox in ‘Ceres’, it’s clear that this is a special record, a fact only reinforced as it unfolds between the subtly daring, detached treatment of J.S. Bach in ‘Bach Gamba F*ucked’, and the celestial vectors of ‘Palimpsest/Too Near’, before the gently pendulous rhythm of ‘Lyricisty of Panic’ begins to pull influence from Baroque, as much as traditional African music and Berlin kosmiche, and ambient arabesque of ‘The Secret Lives of Plankton’ extends into lush synth zones recalling Laurie Spiegel’s ‘Unseen Worlds’. The other side only gets more intriguing, chiming in with the synthetic serenity of Maggi Payne’s ‘Crystal’ in the floating ambience of ‘June 29th (The Third Space)’, and puckering our nerves with the bittersweet intonation of ’Sumite karissimi’, her synth version of a 14th C. work by Magister Zacharias, whilst ‘Queen Anne’s Lace’ drifts from choral meditation to flanged church bells with a surreal, waking dream quality, and the pulsing arps of her remarkable ‘Áve Giove’ brings the Lorenzo Senni inspiration into tangible focus, yet with that elusive, ambiguously oneiric quality that makes the whole album so subtly transfixing. less"

   "name": "Maja S.K. Ratkje’s spellbinding ‘Sult’ is based on her soundtrack for the ballet suite by Jo Strømgren for the Norwegian national ballet. Leading on from her previous solo LP ‘Crepuscular Hour’, Ratkje is here accompanied by a wildly modified, out-of-tune pump organ in 9 wonderous songs that attest to her non pareil, improvisational brilliance. Stemming from the ballet adaptation of ‘Sult’, Knut Hamsen’s classic novel about a starving writer in late 19th century Kristiania (now Oslo), Maja’s treatment closely follows its themes in the lyrics and music, but works as a distinctive document in its own right. Under song titles taken from the novel, Maja unfurls surreal, anachronistic scenes akin to a steampunk echo of olde Oslo. Using an era-appropriate pump organ rigged with metal and PVC tubes, and a wind machine built in, along with resin threads, metal and glass percussion and bow - which she had to learn to play before recording - Maja regales the narration with a fine but beautifully loose grasp of her instrument’s chaotic analog nature, skilfully harmonising with her own, incredible vocal abilities. Despite having never read the book or visited Oslo, Maja’s music and singing takes us right there, to the same cold cobbled streets where Hamsen wrote his semi-autobiographical account of a starving artist trying to make it, and where you might encounter images that gave rise to Edvard Munch’s ’Skrik’ [1893]. Through the resilience of her voice and the queasy, off-kilter shanty feel of the pump organ, Maja most romantically and acutely connotes that atmosphere with the timeless charm of a bard, troubadour or dramaturgist, or quite simply the ambiguous, dreamy nature of the most potent art. less"

Drawing a school of listeners to the floor of Commend’s relatively small interior on a late July Sunday afternoon in 2018, Emily A. Sprague and Lightbath (aka Bryan Noll) provided an hour of aqueous reflections that whispered with the trees outside on Forsyth street and tempered the activity of the surrounding island. Frequent collaborators, Sprague and Noll have been traveling some years on the same light ship through music, friendship, darkness, and spiritual joy, sailing not only the same creative waters of improvised ambient music but also of deeper life events, providing support and connection. full/new represents the cosmic encounter of these two amongst friends, their complementary sets in healing ceremony, celebration and reunion. To begin, Lightbath (in collaboration with a plant via the MIDI Sprout) daubs an arc of floaty melodics, chalky auras and affecting chimes into space. Nurtured by Noll’s composer-gardner spirit, “full” manifests a magnetic kineticism as person and machine travel together exchanging ideas in turn, flowing with the motion and change of the tides. An articulation of weightless abundance, “full” is balanced by the complementary piece “The Hermit”, a seven-minute piece recorded six days before the event using the same configuration of modules. Noll describes “The Hermit” as a meditation on one zone while its dynamic sibling, “full” is a stream of consciousness journey through multiple. If “full” portrays voluptuous movement, “new” is its accompanying voice of possibility and renewal. Sprague pulls listeners into a thin cocoon of reverie, swayed gently by arpeggios in positive and negative acceleration. An interlude of rustling, trickling, bird calls and the occasional tapping signals the frolicking of polyphonic melodies over a swelling, sonorous bass. The final movement stills out into a sanguine solitude, leaving us with a single, extended note.” less"

Imagine the sound of dolphins swimming through soil, or Wanda Group finding his true form as a bed of nettles…​ ‘Vegetal Negatives’ brings to light Finnish artist Marja Ahti’s deeply sensuous and texturally-aware style of holistic composition, giving voice to the natural world as a prism through which to imagine what happens when the natural order of biology and physics mutate in unreal ways. This poetic license opens up Marja’s sound to vivid reaches of the imagination. Moving on from her string of albums as Tsembla, and her work in the Kemialliset Ystävät and Kiila ensembles, she navigates a lushly overgrown garden of the mind in four parts. Two longer sections ‘Coastal Inversion’ and ‘Chora’ offer immersive space-time manipulations, with the former meshing brittle, glassy sounds with head-wobbling acoustic chicanery to sound like some jellified gamelan orchestra, while the 12 minute ‘Chora' - laced with deeply strange, breathing organisms, most spellbindingly gives voice to the natural world, both human, and, in effect, Ur-Terrestrial. They’re separated by two more concise works, the para-dimensional space of ‘Rooftop Garden’ with its richly evocative segues between mechanical and environmental sounds, and ’Symbiogenesis’, which sounds like phosphorescing flora singing to each other after sundown. less"

During the 18 months she lived in Cherry Valley, K Á R Y Y N wrote two songs for 'THE QUANTA SERIES'.

A deep connection to her lineage is a concurrent theme in K Á R Y Y N’s work, with an interpretation of traditional Armenian folk song 'AMBETS GORAV' present on the album plus a beautiful choral patchwork called 'MIRROR ME' providing an introspective break in the album - a track about \"facing yourself, the good, the bad; searching for the parts in us that have been lost.\" less"

It renders a poetically insightful study of life in London, where she ekes out a sense of shadow-strafing play from its fetid streets, revelling in the spaces between sticky pavements and 24 hour off license-lit environs with a signature mix of ennui and louche observation framed by layered and attractively tacky production. As an emigre living in the UK, Lolina’s perspective is perhaps ever more intriguing in the current climate of both footie, Novichok and Brexit fevers as her experience of the city feels embedded yet dreamily detached, with bright, fizzing synth presets and smudged, viscous rhythms meshed to her vocals in a manner that connotes a red-eyed mind drifting dazed between dawning afternoons and smeared evenings, coolly beguiled at the scenes unfolding around her. The result is Lolina’s smartest solo record, a perfect headphone accompaniment to the capital, reflecting its character and characters in its mix of quizzically jazzy and arcane, chamber-like turns of phrase with sparing daubs of field recording peppered by ear-snagging lines such as “your eyes are one, your voice around me / why don’t you leave me in peace, to smoke my trees” in the massive highlight ‘A Path of Weeds and Flowers’, or the sung/spoken schismatics of “fake city/real city/cut the fug with a shank” in the drowsy jag of ‘Fake City, Real City’.

Mdou got to this point after his self-taught, fiery guitar skills were heard by Christopher Kirkley ov Sahel Sounds, who, after a few phone calls (Mdou dropped the first one, thinking it was a prank), secured Mdou’s ‘Tahoultine’ song for the now-seminal ‘Music From Saharan Cellphones’ compilation in 2010. A string of celebrated LPs have followed, including Mdou’s soundtrack for a Saharan remake of Prince’s ‘Purple Rain’, and now on ‘Ilana (The Creator)’ he finally shows what he can do in a true studio setting, and with bios own band. The results are wider, more layered, and immersively lusher than anything else in Mdou’s oeuvre, yet they lose none of the in-the-moment “life” found in his rawer, earlier works, or indeed his transfixing live performances across the EU and USA. Comprising long hours of jamming in the studio, with later overdubs made in Niger, ‘Ilana (The Creator)’ harnesses Mdou and his group’s mesmerising energy in 9 songs, coursing with the kind of psychedelic feel that begs eyes closed and heads-down from the magnetic swiller of ‘Kamane Tarhanin’ thru the wide open blues space connoted by ‘Inizgam’, to the elegant, swaying rhythms and lilting harmonies in ‘Anna’, and a scorching tribute to Tuareg folklore in ‘Ilana’, with incendiary music underlining lyrics about France’s exploitation of Niger’s uranium reserves. less"

Brooker places the spotlight particularly on some of the incredible Ukwuani musicians from the Delta State region as guitarist Rogana Ottah and Steady Arobby’s International Brothers Band forged their own fluid brand of highlife and soulman Don Bruce drew on the US R&B greats for a series of great albums and explosive stage shows at his residency at Hilton Hotel in Abuja.

I remember watching the scene where the mother is compared to Maria Timofeyevna, it all went around in my head like a dream; like a world of associations that surrounded my feelings.

   "name": "A wistful, fractal collection of introspective songs built from fragments of other people’s voices, sounds, and music by French/Canadian artist Jean Cousin aka Joni Void “Mise En Abyme is the second full-length by Joni Void, the avant-electronica project of France/Canada producer Jean Cousin, following his acutely accomplished and acclaimed 2017 debut album Selfless. (#8 Experimental Album of 2017 at Pitchfork, among other accolades.) Grappling with a cascade of heartbreaks and discontinuities over the past year, Cousin calls the new album a “time-travel experiment”, as he culls sounds from devices and sources spanning childhood to the present (phones, cameras, video games, home movies) to retrieve and reframe subjective memories, histories and “regressions through former selves” through immersion in the evocative potential of the mostly wordless voices of others. The resulting sonic portraits simultaneously convey formally abstract dislocations and highly emotive warmth, interiority, humanity and specificity. Side A especially highlights these works – the “with people” half of the album, replete with contemplative, melancholic songs, each featuring a deconstructed performance by a different female voice, propelled to varying degrees with additive rhythmic and textural layers. Side B is the “isolation” half: vocal samples continue to make appearances, including Cousin’s own voice on the vertiginous “Voix Sans Issue” and his own lyrics on the computer-narrated text-to-speech spoken word of the confessional “Deep Impression” – but the contrasting vibe is more claustrophobic, anxious and febrile. Mise En Abyme ends with a throwback to Cousin’s pre-Joni Void keyboard-based works as johnny_ripper on the gorgeous Rhodes piece “Persistence”, while the closing exuberant maximalist jam of “Resolve” fittingly samples every previous song and locks the album into a self-referential recursive sequence.” less"

   "name": "Bringing to a close a series which has frankly altered the way we listen to and perceive sound and music over the course of this decade, Jakob Ullmann seals his important Fremde Zeit series with ‘Solo V for Klavier’; a fascinatingly stark and spectral hour-long finale that sets the idea of ‘Foreign Time’ in its most minimalist and broadest setting. Like the previous instalments, ‘solo V für Klavier’ is interpreted from a graphic score, this time formed from a series of abstract water-colours aleatorically overlaid with transparent sheets marked with black lines, scattered in the manner of oracle sticks to create a pattern determining the duration of sections, their colour and sequencing. Whilst patently super-minimal, the piece’s pianissimo nature is too demanding for just one solo performer, Lukas Rikli, who requires the participation of three assistants who use horsehair on the strings to sustain the soundscape. So far, so concrete (and the above is only a skim of the full technical requirements), but what occurs arguably falls within the realm of the supernatural and metaphysical. Performed according to Ullmann’s uniquely conjured laws of physics, the work opens an uncanny valley between the object - the grand piano - and subjective perceptions of its sound. It takes several minutes before one might even realise a piano is at the centre of the soundstage - somehow all the action appears to happen in the meridian, in the timbral, in the liminal aura, almost frighteningly connoting a presence but not the actual body that produced it. It’s only when identifiable chords and strings occasionally loom forward that we can just about make out the fixed physicalities in the room, but in the process we’ve already attuned to Ullmann’s laws of sonic democracy (if you’re doing it properly, the piece should play at just above the volume of environmental sound - hence it works best at night), which makes any instrumental gesture, no matter how slight, appear magnified, animating a microcosmos of sound at the molecular level. The results highlight the effective warzones of sonic bombardment and “pollution” we’re all subject to everyday, and most intently offer the invaluable space for retreat we’re all clearly, increasingly in need of. less"

Writing from a distance, it’s clear that History is the first classic album in her canon and arguably a classic of the 21st Century underground music panorama. While the methodology on History hadn’t changed from Nilsson’s previous 3 albums – it was recorded solo at The Lighthouse, Nilsson’s home studio based on a Berlin crossroads – on this record the songwriting reached a new peak and the emotional scythe cut deeper. Here, Nilsson managed to combine a cosmic, outward looking perspective with an intimate knowledge of the human condition and its place in these turbulent times. In truth, no other songwriter has excavated the modern psyche so clearly and perfectly. The tracklist to Nilsson’s fourth album reads as an early greatest hits for Molly Nilsson followers and also serves as the perfect entry point to a whole world the artist has been building for the last 10 years. In Real Life crystalises the millenial obsession with relationships built online, with a generation paying for the baby boomer’s excesses with their anxiety towards the harshness of every day life. It’s a call to arms for a generation who fell in love on Skype. On I Hope You Die, one of Molly Nilsson’s most iconic songs, the songwriter flips the song title into a tale of doomed romance, a relationship based on miscommunications and the thrill of the other. It’s also one of the most heartfelt songs full of pathos written by anyone, an ode to obsession. Doomed romance, life lived on the flipside of day and the role of the outsider in society are themes that crop up through-out History. On Bottles Of Tomorrow, the narrator is sweeping up, in love with the night and examining the remains a society leaves behind.” less"

Presented as an album ruminating on what it is to be British in 2018, aside from the obvious shame and embarrassment, it locates a strength in numbers and our eccentricities with a cast of a thousand performers responding to the premature ejaculation of Article 50. Between them, they document an imagined journey on foot across Great Britain thru a mix of elegiac melodies with site-specific recordings of Chequers, a Welsh sheep farm, felled WWII planes, and walks along the Northern Irish border that lend a poetic, historically apt reading of a country entering the grip of madness. Across the album’s 16 songs Herbert and co pull from every aspect of the past two years of Brexit, from interminable news cycles to a spectrum of British eccentricities, to our intrinsic links with the rest of the world, not to mention the EU. The results frame a contemplative collection of arrangements that, while sadly unlikely to change any Brexiteers minds, may at the least give them pause for thought, to reflect on all the good shit they’re so eager to extinguish. It would be presumptuous of us to expect that all of our UK customers share our sentiment, but we’d wager a £10 that most of you do, and likewise many of our EU and RoW customers.

It’s a touch that adds both punch and balance, allowing their inherent conceptual voices to converge into a collage with defined edges and warm, synapses of frequency and beat. “Musically, Hypnos is a return to polyphony after several years of using strictly monophonic synthesizers,” McBride says about the album’s ethos. “This has brought dense harmonies and a more complex counterpoint to the composition. Staying with the same equipment and processes without the inveterate compulsion to update and refashion allows for a clearly perceivable genealogy with our previous work.” “I felt the desire to tell mythical stories, I also wanted my voice to sit strongly in the mix,” Wendelbo explains. “I channeled the spirits of 60s French Pop chanteuse Françoise Hardy and 80s New Wave New York icon Tina Weymouth.” Her intentions are best evidenced on the tracks “Angelique,”and “Insomnia,” the former a spry track sung in French, against a springy rhythm. Laden with expanding and contrasting frequency and a penchant for strategic rhythm, Hypnos juxtaposes dance with distance, creating an immersive oeuvre that exudes contrast and control.” less"

Embarking over the bull-whipped Moog bass momentum and banking riffs of 'Brando', Walker is a disturbing yet utterly compelling presence enticing us to cross thresholds into the arcane, uncanny worlds animated by Sunn 0))), whether projecting across the molasses drone trudge of 'Bull' or alternately wilting and lashing out from the percussive attacks and abyssal tar pits of 'Herod 2014'. By 4th song 'Fetish' their path has narrowed to a 'marish corridor of re-amped synth ghouls and spectral noise before distant drums abort the pregnant drones somewhere in the final third, for closing shot, 'Lullaby' to emulsify their unheimlich resolution at its most dramatic, synth-fired and intimate. It's a genuinely remarkable session, surely one of 2014's best. less"

   "name": "Killer-mode Industrial curveballs from cult French duo Geins’t Naït recorded between 1986-1993, the first instalment in a planned trilogy of archival compilations on Low Jack’s Éditions Gravats. They make a sound somewhere in the orbit of minimal Prince/Linndrum productions played at half speed and crossed with early Muslimgauze E.g Oblique Graph. In other words, deadly gear... Following on from the legendary duo’s class 2018 salvo on Vladimir Ivkovic’s Offen Music, Low Jack throws another curveball on Editions Gravats’ with a trove of unreleased Geins’t Naït material showcasing the sexy swivel and atmospheres that distinguished Thierry Merigout and Laurent Petitgrand’s band from the rest of the french industrial scene. Turning inspirations from the Surrealists and Situationists into a rawly fascinating mixture of slow, pendulous rhythms, chattering electronics and over-the-shoulder vocals, the results are evidently a prime fit for Gravats' expanding catalogue of psychedelic, percussive oddities. ‘Archives 1/3’ volleys 11 examples of the art brut pair hewing at the coalface of industrial music, locating rich seams of rhythm-driven experimentation that still sound vital, over 30 years later. In the process, it highlights a tangible link between early industrial musick, its tribalist reference points, and the current state of play in dancehalls across the world, where everything from ragga to techno and noise are fair game. To be specific, DJs and dancers will be in their element with roughshod aces such as the swivelling might of ‘Fix’, the industrial martial arts of ‘Quivala’, and the squashed pressure of ‘La Plus Belle De Tout’ and ‘Abs Trac 1’, but they’re best heard in context of the whole, alongside more possessed workouts such as the Muslimgauze-in-tongues vibe of ‘Rossi Aldo’, the Godlflesh-like seethe of ‘Roman’, and the kind of necrotising, slowed-down EBM darkness in ‘Cameo’ which wouldn’t sound out of place on the ‘Decoder’ soundtrack. less"

It’s all too rare that we’re totally wowed by movie soundtracks nowadays - Mica Levi’s Under The Skin being the most recent, memorable example - but we can safely add The Childhood of a Leader to that small, sacred pile of works which operate perfectly well when separated from their visual analog - the sort of detailed, image-rich sounds and compositions which future producers and artists will be mining for generations to come. Taking its cues from Jean-Paul Sartre’s short story of the same title, the film’s psychological dramas are matched move for move by Walker’s arrangements, tasking a small army of 46 string players and 16 brass for the studio recording, aided by co-producer Peter Walsh and musical director Mark Warman in drawing out truly ravenous and shocking performances by all involved. There is nothing sentimental or showy about this record, just a classicist grasp of orchestral music’s most timeless affect, filtered thru the mind of a perennial outlier and distilled to intoxicating proof with some subtle but vital electronic enhancements. 100% amazing.

Drawn from some 30 years of Pablo’s Eye material, ‘Dark Matter’ oscillates between the shadowy feels found in their ‘Spring Break’ compilation, and their rhythm-driven inclinations from the stunning ‘Bardo For Pablo’ 12”. As Stroom so beautifully put it, the sound of Pablo’s Eye “is a temporary atmosphere, like a taste or dream…”, and that ephemeral nature is poignantly key to the 12 tracks on offer’, as they drift from theatrical vignettes such as ‘Worship & Passion’ to intoxicating, noirish percussion and drones redolent of Muslimgauze in ‘Different Observers’, and onto reverberating, spacious drum and drone works such as ‘A Pagan Use’ and the trip-hop of ‘Out of the Corner of Her Eye’, via absorbing arabesques like the serene ambient blush of ‘When You Were Asleep’ and ‘L.A.

   "name": "A minimalist masterpiece and pinnacle of the 20th century classical canon, this boxset collects all four parts of Steve Reich’s Drumming, plus Six Pianos and Music For Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organs on vinyl for the first time in over 40 years. Marking an important intersection of western avant-garde thought with percussive practices inspired by Ghanaian drum rituals and Balinese gamelan ceremonies, Reich’s seminal recording has inspired countless composers since it was realised in 1973 and recorded in Hamburg, 1974, casting indelible influence over successive waves of electronic dance music - from disco to techno - thru post rock, indie-pop and all integers between them over the course of a radiant, enduring lifespan. In fact, anyone would struggle to fully sum up the impact these recordings have had on modern music, from the way in which they effectively offered a transcendent solution to the difficulties of the serialist music which preceded them through use of innovative strategies of phasing repetition and psychoacoustic effects, to their refreshing and mesmerising pairing of percussion and vocals in distinctly unique harmonic structures, which flipped staid ideas of classical convention on their head with a new democracy of frequencies. Whilst they are most certainly the result of long, studious hours of dedication and rigorous communal practice, ultimately the beauty of all three pieces lies in their ostensible, affectively engaging simplicity; from the hypnotically infectious pulse which underpins Drumming and the way in which it naturally swoons in and out of phase, to the elegantly airborne lift of Six Pianos and the gently rapturous vocal percolations of Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ.

This is totally blowing our tiny minds right now; a breathtaking suite of unclassified but life-affirming electronic music for Buchla, Publison, Macintosh and Turntables by American composer Carl Stone, mostly previously unpublished, this is only his 2nd vinyl release since 1983! Strongly tipped to fans of Steve Reich, Julia Holter, Robert Ashley, The Automatics Group, Pinkcourtesyphone. A student of composition under Morton Subotnick and James Tenney at CalArts, Stone has exclusively produced electro-acoustic music since 1972, mostly issued on CD by academic-leaning labels until now, as Unseen Worlds fulfil their role in facilitating “quality editions of unheralded and revolutionary, yet accessible, avant garde music” with this truly revelatory compilation. It lights up our pleasure centres like a quid in a fruit machine, using a palette of eastern-tuned scales, processed vocals and pop samples to conjure a majorly playful array of idiosyncratic, angular and intriguing arrangements that resonate with Robert Ashley’s mercurial cut-ups as much as The Automatics Group’s incisive dance pop detournements and the proto-glitch music of Nicolas Collins. It’s all totally new to us and feels like somebody just opened a big skylight onto our listening lives, flooding us with new sensations between the baroque computer music of Sukhothai (1977) and the wormholing drone of Chao Praya (1973), taking in the soothingly ethereal Shing Kee (1986) and strobing structure of Don II Jang (1982), along with the haunting nocturnal transition of Kuk Il Kwan (1981) to lay out whole new worlds before your ears.

It’s just mad on so many levels, right up there with the Afro-cubist abstractions of Jamal Moss and Nolan Reusse at their best. Originally conceived as the soundtrack to an installation but ultimately arriving on this one-sided piece of wax, 15 Barras trades in Nigga Fox’s usual dancefloor intensity and immediacy for something more slow burning and experimental in structure and duration. An elasticated 303, or 303 emulation, is the glue that holds the piece together, coming in sticky waves of jabbing, writhing rhythm, accreting diced chants and swells of clamouring crowd noise that eventually hinge around a splintered claps and trills of hollow, wooden blocks of percussion at ruggedest angles. Drop this at the right point in the dance and you’ve got at least enough time for a really leisurely slash, and maybe even roll a zoot before returning to the dance and finding everyone melted in some kind of Cronenbergian amorphorgy.

In the context of the album, the Panda Bear-vocalled 'Things Fall Apart' makes perfect sense, preparing the ground for the fetid fourth world techno of 'Salamander'. 'Digital Rain' and 'Devil Lay Here' are pure, Zomby-patented dubstep bubble-bobble, the latter knocked nicely off-kilter by ear-worming horn sounds, while the wild-pitching arpeggios of 'Mozaik' and 'Black Orchid' hark back to his game-changing Hyperdub double-pack. 'Florence' teams the most delicate, tremulous piano sequences with scuttling junglist breakbeats, prompting inevitable comparisons with classic Aphex gear; pianos are in fact all over the album, culminating in the straight-faced, unadorned solo piece 'Basquiat'.

It reunites Zagar with Nick Zammuto, the renowned composer and co-founder of beloved collage-pop pioneers, the Books. Inspired by the film’s setting in rural upstate New York – and influenced by the early ambient electronic music that galvanized the Books two decades ago – Zammuto pairs that earthen, wooded isolation with dynamic pulses of customized electronics and sparse, crystalline layers of melodic soft synths. The juxtaposition is arresting, and gives the soundtrack a unique heft befitting of its subject matter – and betraying of its minimal instrumentation. Beautifully edited and sequenced to act as both a companion to the film and a standalone album, We The Animals: An Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is as subtle as it is startling, and succeeds in making even the heaviest emotions feel momentarily weightless.” less"

   "name": "One of those rare artists who gets better with each release, Susanna is joined again by partner and producer Helge Sten (Deathprod), and a new band of Norse whippersnappers - The Brotherhood of Our Lady - for a soaring suite inspired by Hieronymus Bosch. While Susanna’s vocals and song-writing channel Joni Mitchell, Nina Simone, Tori Amos and Diamond Galas, the musical palette is wonderfully singular, with sophisticated piano and string arrangements riddled with unconventional details. In the loveliest sense this is an album both my folk-loving mother and I could enthuse about. \"The incredible, ahead-of-its-time art of medieval Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch bears strong comparison with the music of Norwegian artist Susanna. Visionary, disturbing, spiritual; vivid images of darkness and light, good and evil, heaven and hell and the folly of mankind. Like her songs, Bosch’s iconic images range from the panoramic to the intimate, and express bliss, torment and tortuous inner conflicts. On Garden of Earthly Delights, her 13th album, Susanna takes a selection of Bosch’s paintings as starting points for a fervent, poetic rosary of fantastical songs and stories. Tracks like ‘Gluttony and Lust’, ‘Death and the Miser’ and ‘Ship of Fools’, reflect Bosch’s depictions of sin and human weakness, while ‘Wayfarer’, ‘Ecstasy’ and ‘Beautiful Life’ suggest the transcendent search for spiritual rewards. Originally a commissioned work for the Vossajazz Festival 2017, Garden of Earthly Delights ranges from soul searching balladry to sonorous electronic expanses. Some listeners might catch echoes of the melodic range of Joni Mitchell, the confessional darkness of Nina Simone and the traumatised intensity of Diamanda Galas, filtered through a medieval folk and modern experimental sensibility. But there’s no mistaking the powerful, questing clarity of Susanna’s distinctive voice, and the core of symbolic imagery she draws on from ancient mythology via medieval mysticism to present-day consumer society. Accompanying her own wanderings on vocals, piano and electronics, Susanna assembled The Brotherhood of Our Lady, a new group (named after the religious organisation that sponsored Bosch) drawn from Norway’s current dynamic, young and open minded music scene, with members of bands like Skadedyr, Stina Stjern, Listen to Girl and Propan. The album was recorded in the extraordinary Ocean Sound Studio on the Northwest coast of Norway, a fully equipped wooden hut that sits on a rocky outcrop at the edge of the sea. All programming and production was done by Susanna and regular partner Helge Sten (Supersilent, Deathprod), with mixing by Andrew Scheps (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Lana Del Rey, First Aid Kit, etc). The team and the wild location extract some of Susanna’s spookiest and richest sonic performances to date, with a vivid range of colours to match Bosch’s extravagant imagery.” less"

   "name": "‘Wandelaar’ is a time-dilating suite of solo piano, strings and electronic ambience realised by Haron Aumaj as the first release on a promising new Dutch label, Queeste - properly gorgeous stuff. As first introductions go, Wandelaar is a memorable one. Over the course of seven pieces, Haron extends a modest invitation to his world with the spare, Roger Eno-esque air of solo keys and floating synth tons in Lotuseater, before opening out the vast symphonic panorama of Maangerij and seamlessly segueing into the windswept arps of Caverne with in a manner recalling a more tempered TCF. The journey reaches a hallucinatory apex with the staggering proprioceptive sound design of Selenieten evoking febrile imagery of incomprehensible scale and dynamics, and we’re swept, dreamlike, into the playfully frothy, melodic keys of Foschia, which make for a stark contrast with the fleeting blue grey notes of Sepia that lead into the lip-tingling, head-thizzing expression of his Music for Elbows, charmingly evoking comparisons to Ryuichi Sakamoto at his most deliquescent, as much as a tipsy, sun-dazed Emahoy Tsegué-Maeryam Guèbrou work. It's an engrossing, brilliant album that comes highly recommended for those of you looking beyond Ambient-by-numbers fodder. less"

Frazzled, unhinged, and frankly odd sh*t, this! “Souk’s fourth release is a daring adventure in global beats. Frequently it comes to mind the universe of Quasimoto, Madlib’s abstract hip hop that sounded delicious in the early 2000s. Chupame El Dedo lives in the same kind of power trip, fuelled by intense salsa rhythms dressed with heavy metal images.That’s where Satan comes into place. The Devil wears many clothes, but none are as multi-coloured and trendy as the ones we see in “No Te Metas Con Satan”. We are advised of that during the first side of the LP. Each song dares the listener, with a multitude of ideas, sometimes dissonant ones, that find their way to make sense. An example? The first song “No Te Metas Con Satan” sounds like a perverted version of “Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?” and when you think it’s over, it starts again, repeating ideas and leaving you extremely confused. What the fuck just happened? Chupame El Dedo happened. And it goes on. Flip to the other side and “Alexandra Candelaria” says hi. A 7:43 minute long sinful & hilarious soup opera. No-one is ready for this. Laughter mixes with intense head banging, while we listen to what would happen if Jodorowsky made a Cartoon Network show. A damn good one. Maybe it’s a good idea to not mess around with Satan, but you’ll be in serious trouble if you don’t listen to this. Seriously.” less"

Following up Soul Jazz's excellent retrospective on Arthur's disco material - now things really start getting serious. Mostly the material here is derived from two unreleased albums worth, a 1985 test pressing entitled 'Corn' and a long planned album for Rough Trade, worked on between 1986 - 90 and eventually shelved when Russell became too ill to complete, or let go of his material. Arthur's curious, optimistic vocal - lifting us away from the corporeal into true mantric territories - is just completely inimitable and life affirming. The lyrical preoccupations with american upbringing and life could perhaps be found in an imaginary midpoint somewhere between Frank O'Hara's 'Lunch poems' and Billy Collins. His beloved cello and drum machine experiments still sound vital and completely innovative. Check 'Calling All Kids' for the beautiful Walter Gibbons remix, bringing us full circle back to the disco Arthur held so dear. Russell emerges head and shoulders above, standing on the outside looking in, but glad of the fresh air. This is a must. less"

   "name": "The Death of Rave plates up the first ever vinyl release from NYZ; the cult, algorithmic/generative music project of award-winning artist/scientist Dave Burraston (Bryen Telko, Noyzelab), featuring one track using synths given him by Richard D. James - a peer and star of Dave’s famous ’SYROBONKERS!’ interview. ’It comes highly recommended to followers of Russell Haswell’s kaotic gnash, the mind-bending tunings of Aphex Twin, the visionary algorithmic scapes of Roland Kayn, and Eliane Radigue’s microtonal meditations. ’SHFTR FRQ’ showcases the breadth of Burraston’s experimental research into algorithmic/generative composition. The A-side revolves 14 succinct blatz ranging from cranky percussive pieces to queered microtonal dissonance and SAW II-like atmospheres - notably including one track made on a Sequentix Cirklon sequencer and PreenFM2 synth gifted him by Richard D. James - while the B-side contains a steeply immersive spectral drone tract that (never) ends in a locked groove, especially cut at D&M, Berlin. The results are wholly unique and speak to the endless, playfully experimental variation of NYZ’s art/research. They reveal visceral, alien microcosms of curdled microtonal tunings and proprioceptive chicanery bound to thrill and induce strange, new sensations in even the most hard-to-please fiend of electronic music. In Dave’s own words: “SHFTR FRQ is a series of experimental studies into simple synth setups controlled by varying levels of generative complex systems [MANIAC cellular automata]. Recorded over the last 6 years on an ever changing hybrid of equipment encompassing the domains of modular & MIDI based microtonal sound synthesis [analogue & digital]. Setups were always ultra-minimalist, often with just the MANIAC cellular automata sequencer and 1 or 2 modules/synths to provide a consistent sensory focus. The studies range from ultra-short sequences, micro-ditties, investigatory motifs, to a full length high spectral drone meditation. + [Special note for track A9 - SHFTR_CA#BB1] => A huge shout of thanks to Richard D James for gifting me a Sequentix Cirklon sequencer and PreenFM2 synth during my Regional Arts Fellowship in 2017!

   "name": "‘And We Are Passing Through Silently’ is the sublime first survey of reworks/remixes by cult synthesist Abul Mogard, including extended reworks of Brian Eno and Gordon Sharp (Cindytalk), Aïsha Devi, Fovea Hex, Penelope Trappes and more. Arguably one the bigger enigmas in modern synth music, Abul Mogard has established a reputation for his singular synth works, mostly issued by Steve Moore’s VCO and Alessio Natalizia’s Ecstatic label since 2012. Prized for his slow-building, etheric and beatific style of composition, Mogard has also been in demand as a remixer over the years, and it’s in this role that Houndstooth focus upon, rounding up and presenting a handful of his strongest remixes for other artists, including many on vinyl for the first time. In each case Mogard extracts the artist or band’s essence and diffuses it into his own, billowing soundscapes with a time-dilating, meditative and romantic appeal that’s long been at the core of his synthy magick. Where Abul’s solo work is purely instrumental, his reworks are the only place you’ll find him handling with vocals, and the best of those are found in ‘And We Are Passing Through Silently’. Perhaps understandably, he’s most impressive when working with other veteran souls. This is most clearly apparent on the 2nd disc, offering a stunning expansion of Gordon Sharp’s plaintive vocal in Massimo Pupillo/Becoming Animal’s ‘The Sky Is Ever Falling’ that surely reminds of his earliest work with This Mortal Coil, while he also deeply enchants with a glacial rendering of Fovea Hex and Brian Eno’s ‘We Dream All The Dark Away’ that sounds like it escapes a Clannad Seance in ’89. Factor in a vertiginous spin of Aïsha Devi’s ‘O.M.A.’, the gently psychedelic rework of Nick Nicely’s ‘London South’, and a sweetly refined mix of Penelope Trappes, and it’s not hard to hear what all the fuss about, especially if you like Alessandro Cortini or Steve Moore! \"Rounding up divine renderings of songs by Aïsha Devi, Penelope Trappes (The Golden Filter) and nick nicely (heralded by luminaries of the US underground Ariel Pink and John Maus), the album culminates with Brian Eno’s collaboration with Irish avant-folk band Fovea Hex. Also included is Abul’s brand new rework of Becoming Animal’s ‘The Sky Is Ever Falling’ featuring vocals from Cinder (This Mortal Coil/Cindytalk) and Massimo Pupillo on bass (Zu/Thurston Moore/Stephen O’Malley), exclusive to this release.

   "name": "Unmissable, cult Scottish punk zinger from 1986, returning 33 revs later via Good Energy, a new label from Jennifer Lucy Allen (Arc Light Editions) and Kevin McCarvel (Nyali Recordings). Imagine Einstürzende Neubauten in kilts, playing in a cow shed, and punking up Robbie Burns… “Raw as hell record from the 1980s Scottish underground by Nyah Fearties, who toured Arran in kilts, who built a percussion setup from scaffolding and oil drums, who appeared on The Tube on the back of a moving lorry, and recorded this, their first album, in a cow shed in Ayrshire with just a car’s cassette deck as a monitor. Don’t expect this to sound soft or slick because it isn’t, and therein lies its glory. Released on vinyl 1986, and later circulated under the counter as an unofficial CD-R, it’s bounced around the Glaswegian underground for decades. The master tapes went missing but with the approval of Davy Wiseman it’s been dragged kicking and screaming back into the world as a limited LP run and digital release, and contains perhaps the most chaotic detournement of a Robbie Burns folk ballad ever laid to tape. Nyah Fearties are from the village of Lugton, and created a near-unique brand of anarchic modern folk in the 1980s and 1990s. “Simple Minds, Orange Juice and The Jesus And Mary Chain were from Scotland but Nyah Fearties are about Scotland” said one review. Their feral Celtic punk is influenced by industrial groups like Einsturzende Neubaten, who inspired a scaffolding and scrap metal percussion setup that became known as ‘the blatter cage’, making them unwelcome wherever they went. Fearties are a duo of brothers Davy and Stephen Wiseman, and this record also includes, “the Entire Company on anything they can lay their hands on” according to original sleevenotes. The brothers toured, appeared on TV, and later supported The Pogues on tour, and these successes allowed them to release better recordings under improved conditions. Originally released in 1986 and reissued now by Good Energy, a co-production between Jennifer Lucy Allan (Arc Light Editions) and Kevin McCarvel (Nyali Recordings). Good energy thanks all involved, especially Cal Wiseman and the one with the best energy: Davy Wiseman.

   "name": "Without question, some of the most beautiful Quiet music you'll likely ever hear, compiled in a 4 hour-long triple disc set. 'Fremde Zeit - Addendum' collects five pieces of engrossingly etheric, liminal composition by Jakob Ullmann (1958), the widely acknowledged master of quiet music and cover star of The Wire magazine. For us, as we'd imagine many others, this is a striking first introduction to the devoted German minimalist's very particular body of work. Comprising 4 hours of barely-there strings, percussions, wind instruments and voices prefaced by the instruction \"Please choose, for each piece, the volume settings of your sound system so as to just barely mask the ambient sounds in the room\", this is music made for concentrated listening, recorded and specifically designed to give listeners \"the opportunity to hear more, and better\" by the simple but essential notion that \"We hear better because we make an effort to hear better.\" With this is mind, we're invited into a sound world which actively, yet effortlessly and sublimely challenges our perceptions of space and time with a compelling, transcendent effect akin to that of listening to music by, say, Eliane Radigue or Morton Feldman, yet with an alien, detached appeal entirely its own. Due to their extended durations - no piece is shorter than 34 mins, and over an hour at the longest - we form temporal impressions which blur the boundaries between our immediate space and the apparent vastness of the recording, teasing our sixth sense to wander on a knife edge of trepidation and somnolence. Yet, musically, it covers a far more subtle spectrum of emotions and cabalistic atmospheres casting metaphoric allusions to \"…antiquity, to the Middle Ages, to the Baroque, to the 20th Century and to the present\" by means of its extreme dilation of space/time and anticipation, and relegation of distortion or any untempered gestures. Once you've heard this music it should come as little surprise Ullmann studied sacred music in Dresden from 1979-1982 - his music could be the lingering resonance of an Arvo Pärt piece played in a huge cathedral, and it carries the weight of history - spanning over 18 years of work, the results are duly, deeply considered. A revelatory package, whose impact will surely emerge and manifest as slowly, yet powerfully, as the music itself. less"

   "name": "Objekt returns with Cocoon Crush, his first LP since 2014’s Flatland. Over the past four years he has continued to challenge conventions with his club output, while maintaining his reputation as a DJ who deploys impeccable technical finesse in crafting elaborate narratives from a diverse and challenging palette of electronic music. \"Written between 2014 and 2018 in Berlin and on the road, Cocoon Crush once again sees the producer jettisoning the functional requirements of the dancefloor. Marking a further evolution from the youthful exuberance of Flatland, Cocoon Crush explores a more introspective side, with themes of human interaction resonating throughout the record as it ruminates on a spectrum of complex moods rooted in 4 years of sometimes turbulent personal experience. Cocoon Crush represents an aesthetic departure from Flatland’s largely synthetic tonality, drawing from organic source material and natural textures to illustrate perplexing and unfamiliar sceneries in photorealistic detail. In Cocoon Crush, Objekt diverges further still from his musical influences to craft the purest manifestation of his own musical personality to date: an intriguing and enigmatic album whose reference points are hard to pin down, in which ghostly synth passages weave through mind-bending, weighty drums, and ASMR-triggering foley collages scrape and sparkle. Through meticulous sculpting, Objekt traces a rich and impressionistic journey through claustrophobia, hope, guilt, anxiety and joy, nested in layers of sonic detail which reward with every listen.\" less"

   "name": "On this newly released work Jakob Ullmann combines his appreciation of Cageian principles with sacred composition in utterly riveting ways, resulting in two of the most extreme and uncompromising examples of his “quiet music” - that is, a music which is composed and realised to be played just above the volume of each listener’s ambient background. And in case you’re not aware of what we mean by “extreme”, we’re talking seriously quiet - bordering on silent - instrumental gestures; the kind of creaks and klangs that, on the most glib level, recall a “ghost” in your house at midnight, while on a more serious, theological level, are intended to heighten the listener’s sense of the unknown, the metaphysical, the spiritual: the sacred. In both works the ‘hallmarks’ of Jakob Ullmann’s intently defined yet unfathomably open style of composition come to light. On Müntzers stern, a pre-recorded performance of a hymnal text written by the German theologian is played back at barely perceptible volume into the same space where Dafne Vicente-Sandoval translates the graphic score for bassoon. The result is a totally sparse yet breathtakingly pensive piece where it’s beautifully uncertain what we’re hearing - is that the chance sound of a distant plane or Dafne’s bassoon? Are those voices in your head, outside the window, or on the recording? Either way, the barely-there but complex results are genuinely ambiguous, forming a total breakdown of conventions that leave the listener with far more questions than they answer. On solo II, part of a group of works relating to the notion of disappearing musics completed in 1992 following Ullmann’s conversations with John Cage, the effect of Dafne’s bassoon, recorded in Kartäuserkirche (Bürgerliches Waisenhaus) is even more extreme. Holistically taking into account everything from the thermal fluctuation of the space and the way it affects Dafne’s reed, to its unique acoustic imprint, and by turns what lies outside its walls, the piece directly builds on Ullmann’s dialogue with Cage, and induces us into a sort of lucid dream state where time dissolves, outside becomes inside, and we feel physically sublimated into the piece and its projected timbral architecture. As Ullmann’s music has come to light beyond the most rarified classical corridors over the last decade (with thanks to its champions such as Stephen O’Malley and Bill Kouligas, among others), the composer’s radical approach and uncompromising beliefs have given us some of the most memorable and perception-altering musical experiences imaginable. We can surely add these two new Ullmann works to that set of life-affirming and quietly challenging experiences. less"

   "name": "Toresch vocalist Viktoria Wehrmeister becomes Decha with a superb solo debut suite of minimalist, mirage-like songs for Berlin’s Malka Tuti label Also known for her role in La! Neu? with Klaus Dinger during the late ‘90s, Wicki Wehrmeister is the Mexican-German sculptor and artist acclaimed for her schizzy vocals on Toresch’s amazing ‘Essen Für Alle’ EP, where she variously barked, purred and and spat in tongues over Tolouse Low Trax’s sidewinding productions. On ‘Hielo Boca’ however, Viktoria a.k.a. Decha is shorn of beats, allowing her playful character to really come thru in myriad ways while revealing a true enigma at work in the process. Across the album’s nine songs Viktoria wears as many hats, vacillating snarling, punky personas with more naif, airy stylings and seductive croon, and always unafraid to play around with the frayed, natural imperfections and textures of her voice. To cut to the chase, there’s one really big standout, ‘Voy A Very’, where Decha multitracks herself in plaintive harmony over a sluggish, decapitated house riff and smeared brass with transfixing effect, but we reckon it’s best heard in context of the full album, after you’ve witnessed her parse and recombine her various voices and sides between the gurning/puckered glossolalia of ‘Nonja’, the layered acapella cadence of ‘Soy Yo’, where she’s alternately rapper/folkalist, and the likes of ‘La Nena’, where she melts into air like a Cucina Povera or Paavoharju hymn to dreamy whimsy. In the best sense the music on ‘Hielo Boca’ feels in flux, frayed and off-the-cuff, yet highly considered. It’s this play of instinctive and detached nous that makes us sure we’ll return over and again. Highly recommended! less"

But, for anyone familiar (or even slightly obsessed) with her fractious ‘Red Devil’ mixtape, her advance into far more tempered and filigree sound organisation may come as a shock. Her music now more closely resembles the hard-won styles of Arca and Lotic, with stronger binds to mutant R&B and Rap, as well as core influence from SA musics such as Gqom and Kwaito. Where her previous releases were effectively dizzying, abstract descriptions of South Africa and the trans-global Black and queer experience, ‘Death Becomes Her’ merges the figurative and brutalist with more literal, and poetic expressions, for a varied and full frontal definition of Angel-Ho as an artist. Songs such as the Kwaito-esque dance-pop of ‘Like A Girl’, and ‘Muse To You’ are just that, proper dance songs with verse/chorus structures and stunningly animated/animating rhythms, while ‘Baby Tee’ offers a smart sidespin on R&B conventions, and others naturally push the prism toward the avant, as with the use of Bee-Gees choruses in the blinding, off-key and jagged ‘Live’ or the Coil-ed poise of ‘Pose’, or the keening, oblique shape of ‘Bussy’. less"

Big RIYL Kevin Drumm, Iancu Dumitrescu, Mika Vainio, Luigi Nono Following the short-run edition of his ‘DzGI’ tape in 2015, it’s fair to call ‘Corpora Vilia’ Cameron Shafii’s definitive release to date. Consolidating the Ph.D. student and Ge-Stell label boss’s fascinations with the physics of sound, specifically digital synthesis and spectromorphology, Shafii’s 2nd release places exacting techniques at the service of a uniquely refreshing, playful, and genuinely bewildering music. In three durational parts, Shafii presents a wealth of micro-edited sounds arranged into radical synthetic symphonies. Structured around deeply uncanny transitions between acoustic and digital spheres, they each reveal inception-like worlds within worlds, using every integer of the sound field to draw ears between his spectral presences and pointillist acoustic strikes with a quietly breathtaking grasp of proprioceptive chicanery. With ‘Points and Planes of Potential Future Violations’ he establishes a beguiling soundfield foregrounding insectoid electronics over cascading piano arpeggios in the midground, punctuated by percussive violence and leading to head-wrenching chaos recalling Luigi Nono’s ‘Non Consumiamo Marx’ classic. ‘Text 27 (Lise in Fernsehspiel)’ follows, rendering pink hued ambient harmonics centre stage, surrounded by vertically creeping strings while near-infrasonic bass turns the stage to jelly, before ‘Spatial Envy; or Suture and Cut-Pieces’ again extends the strangest timbral combinations and perception-baiting segues. Ultimately it’s one of those releases that will constantly make you stop and double-check what you’re listening to. It’s floored us each time we return to it, at least.

Also, that new cover art is....!!! Stunning Alga Marghen issue of two previously unreleased masterworks by Eliane Radigue recorded at Pierre Henry's studio between 1967-68. At this time she was working for Henry at his studio, given the enviable task of organising his vast sound library according to different criteria for use in his future compositions and also helping edit his masterpiece 'L'Apocalypse de Jean'. During downtime she had access to an unrivaled array of equipment and created these two compositions. Jouet Electronique' (1967) or 'Feedback on magnetic tape' features two Studer and two Tolana reel tape machines - Radigue would set one to record another and manipulate the discrepancies of phasing feedback loops, or \"larsens\" with delicate, fine-tuned pitching, \"slightly caressing certain potentiometers\" to elicit a range of low pulsations and very high pitched sounds as though she were playing a rather unwieldy instrument. The results are ethereal and often alien, yet conducted with an uncannily restrained and human sleight of hand. Even more visceral is 'Elemental I' (1968) or 'Feedback of natural sounds on magnetic tape' comprises four movements associated with the four basic elements: water, fire, air and earth. Thanks to her former employer, the artist, Arman, she now had a small, portable Stella Vox which she used to record sounds in open air during walks around her home in Nice, capturing the sea, the wind, the rain and fire to form a small sound library.

From the vantage point of that hillside, consuming the output of various international black music scenes, the group realized that they shared a desire to use music to celebrate Africa’s contribution to world culture. So they embarked on a journey to create an album, with lyrics in French, English and Portuguese, and with references to a diversity of black rhythmic genres in order to help bridge the gaps that normally separate people of African descent around the world.” less"

   "name": "Available on vinyl for the first time in 40 years, Outernational Sounds proudly presents a crucial document from the Los Angeles jazz underground - the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra at their most together, stretching out on home turf in 1979, with the legendary Horace Tapscott at the helm. \"Horace Tapscott is one of the unsung giants of jazz music. A gifted composer and arranger, a boldly original pianist, and above all a visionary bandleader, Tapscott’s recorded footprint is small, but his legacy continues to vibrate through the Los Angeles music underground. From Freestyle Fellowship to Build An Ark, Kamasi Washington and Dwight Trible, it all traces back to Tapscott. The pianist was an organiser, and instead of chasing a successful recording career, he wanted to build a community band that would act as ‘a cultural safe house for the music.’ ‘I wanted to say, “This is your music. This is black music, and I want to present a panorama of the whole thing right here”’ said Tapscott in the late 1990s. ‘We would preserve the music on our ark, the mothership…’ That mothership was the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra – the Ark. As a culturally radical, communal big band with a visionary approach to American Black music, Tapscott’s group is second only to the other famous Arkestra, that of Sun Ra. Tapscott had founded the group in 1961 as the Underground Musicians Association (UGMA). It changed its name to the Pan African Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and through the seventies the players lived, played and worked together. Community work and political consciousness were at the heart of the project, and for two decades they played in street, park and coffee house. With Tapscott as their guide and mentor, the Arkestra worked with theatre groups, poets and revolutionaries, ran music workshops and teaching sessions for children and adults, and played fundraisers, benefits and rallies for political and social causes both global and local. From 1973 to 1981 their main rehearsal and concert space was the Immanuel United Church of Christ (I.U.C.C.) on 85th St and Holmes Ave. The Arkestra played there every second Sunday, developing their sound and hipping new audiences to their vision. Live At I.U.C.C., recorded in early 1979, was the only live recording the band released. In full flow, and at the height iof their powers, the group recorded here features original 1961 UGMA members Linda Hill, David Bryant and Alan Hines, alongside the powerful voices of a new generation including Jesse Sharps, Sabir Mateen, and Adele Sebastian. Showcasing spiritualised classics from Arkestra’s songbook, including the heavy modal groovers ‘Desert Fairy Princess’ and ‘Macrame’, Live At I.U.C.C. is a rare chance to hear one of the most important, foundational bands in the music stretching out on their own thing. With the great Horace Tapscott at the piano, this is the rarely captured sound of the mothership in full flight!\" less"

Perhaps best known for her improvised rap/noise project Yeah You alongside her dad, Gwilly Edmondes, the artist known as Elvin Brandhi is a vital creative force to be reckoned with on ‘Shelf Life’, hacking and splicing frazzled electronics and her own voice into utterly singular, mutant designs that could hardly have come from anyone else. There’s so much going on that we’re kinda lost for words and left reeling from it all. But if we allow our ears to defocus a little, structures begin to emerge from the chaos, kinda like a T-1000 flailing in molten meckle. Variously, we hear a wild flux of crushed flashcore rhythms a la Croww woven with free-metered vocals and Wanda Group-like gunk in ‘Empty Weeping’, while ‘REAP SOLACE’ recalls an Arca or Lotic piece twysted inside-out, gut spilling, before ‘I SAID IF’ runs roughshod with DJ Scud-style Yardcore and Merzbow-esque shards of electronic noise. And just as you think you’ve got a grip, ‘IMBRED WAILE-OCDC’ invest it all, setting blown-out percussion in acres of negative space with discombobulated pop vocals and blasts of dissonance, then ’Skype Warp’ closes the account cannily close to Klein with a burning but elusive, avant sense of soul.

Icelandic producer Isar Logi Arnarsson aka Cold originally released ‘Strobe Light Network’ on Thule Records in 1995. Traversing iridescent, hallucinatory electronics and submerged, slow dub techno rhythms, the 15 minute beauty was picked up by Sven Väth as the closing track of Love Parade 1996, and now 23 years later it’s lost none of its lip-smacking lustre, surely set to light up a thousand sets over summer 2019. James Bernard’s B-side ‘Lapis Lazuli’ hearkens to the same era, but sees to the other side of the coin to Cold. Written in the early ‘90s, and released in 1997 on the ’Symphony For a Biomechanical Breakdown’ CD for SPK/Lustmord’s Side Effects label, it’s a serpentine coil of flickering acid lines and reticulated 808 patter with a sublime yet slightly menacing effect particular to that dark and sexy seam of the ‘90s. less"

For over twenty years, Mkl Anderson has curated a vast archive of recorded material for his cinematic ritual ambient industrial project, Drekka. He works with memory not only as a subject but also as a healing process, continually delving into this personal world of sound; examining, revisiting, and repurposing recordings in an attempt to recall a past which sings from the darkness surrounding the tenuous provinces of memory and dreams - the real ghosts of time and sound. Recorded between 1996 and 2002, the album showcases Drekka's early exploratory development across a variety of styles. And yet it is also Drekka in the present moment; culled, curated, and assembled with care. Not unlike Borges’ \"A Personal Anthology\" - or indeed any of Drekka’s own recent work - this recording can be understood as a cohesive narrative more than as a simple compilation. As Drekka moved from its Bristol UK influenced space folk beginnings, backwards towards Anderson's earlier UK industrial tape culture foundation, his predilection for reworking pieces over time was emerging; recontextualizing narratives to bring out new truths from one's own history. This process would become a cornerstone of Anderson's work for the decades to follow.” less"

   "name": "Tape Loop Orchestra embark on a new three album series ‘Interiors’ with a ghostly first instalment accompanied by a visual guide of found photos. Offering a restrained, minimalist approach to core ideas about isolationism, the occult, transcendence and the nature of entropy, ‘Interiors One’ unfurls a soundtrack to interiors bereft of inhabitants. Heard and read in conjunction with a pamphlet of Andrew Hargreaves aka TLO’s found photos, the two sides (and a full length CD of extra material) slowly edge into sighing chorales and sepia keys that act as a gauzily familiar yet detached medium for meditation on the spaces we inhabit. The results are detectably more tempered, less overwhelmed by emotion than previous TLO outings. Both of the sidelong sections, containing parts 1 thru 6, are more serenely composed and intangibly diffused into the aether, with TLO’s aching heart feeling as though it’s been unchained and is keening into middle distance around the soundsphere like a quietly lost soul divining communion with other energies . Hargreaves veils emotive signposts and in the process encourages listeners to slow down, find magick in the prosaic, to grasp the extraordinary from the everyday, to listen out for voices, almost like a recording of Alvin Luicier’s most famous work conducted by The Caretaker, retitled “I am sitting in a room, but i’m not actually there, or am I?” less"

Tipped if yr into Burial, Regis, Silent Servant...! Plucked from right under our noses, Salford Electronics appears to be a handle for David Padbury, whose credits for industrial units such as Death Pact International and The Grey Wolves stretch back to the ‘80s. Under the SE mantle however, Padbury pursues a stealthy, menacing blend of industrial ambient, rolling techno and even Burial-esque 2-step that cannily resonates with styles you’ll hear any given weekend at Salford venue, The White Hotel - aka the best (and coldest) venue in the world right now. The Salford Electronics sound is every bit as grim as its moniker implies. Opener ’Shadowfall’ conjures imagery of light dying over Salford’s jagged squarewave horizon of high-rises, Satanic mills and media citadels, before that atmosphere bleeds into the stark negative space and clenched techno tumult of ‘Deconstruction’, streaked with shortwave radio chatter and unheimliuch proclamation from the murk, only to end with a dry echo of Burial’s melancholic 2-step in ‘Breakdown’. And yes, we’re as surprised as you are. Flipside, the effect is compounded by killer Ancient Methods and Vatican Shadow remixes. First spotted in his RA.645 mix, AM’s take on ‘Deconstruction’ is insanely dead-on but pendulous, driven with hungrier bass and whelmed with waves of biting point noise, while Vatican Shadow comes into his own with a tract of zombied, blank-eyed techno gloom. less"

   "name": "Emotional exploration through sound can become so indulgent that it overshadows the journey. \"JH1.FS3 eschews mining the human condition as mediation, opting for nuanced analysis rather than vanity. Using the seeds of improvisation as their root construct, the duo work without code, vocabulary or genre. Instead, they systematically work as individuals in tandem, using disparate and varied sounds and sources to create gauzy collages of ideas, sound and visceral sense reaction. Comprised of Frederikke Hoffmeier (Puce Mary) and Jesse Sanes (Hoax, Liebestod), JH1.FS3 delineates a more subtle “cinema of the ear”, and a cold approach to reflecting on experience without leveraging tropes or familiarity. “We try to reconcile these emotionally massive things in a way that is sincere and measured, but without being sappily diaristic or confessional,” they explain. “A cinematic quality develops really quickly and our attempts to traffic in generalizations, unbiased observers of ‘relationships’ gets turned on its head. We find these sets of unique errors that feel more like Super-8 (film) home footage.” This transference allows cracks and fissured to be filled in new ways, where error is championed—highlighted as intention rather than happenstance. Throughout Trials and Tribulations, their debut LP for Dais records, the reconnection of idea and experience conducted with surgical diligence becomes a mode to deconstruct familiarity through shade and accident. With each exposition on Trials and Tribulations, the duo ornately explores the relationship between space and time by reconfiguring the tendrils and fissures that bind them. Percussive oscillations, descant vocals, and deconstructed patterns create fields that vibrate, plunge, and drone. Sequentially, each track contributes a lucid vignette to the larger account, engaging the listener to query where, when, and how they’re being driven. The contrast of the lead single “Aleppo In Headlines,” with its thrusting syncopation to the cautious beauty of “At the Bottom of the Night” compounds and depth and disquisition of the duo’s process.\" less"

   "name": "Intensely warped electronic noise made at EMS studios by Swedish master Daniel Rozenhall; alternately dense/spacious sides looking deep into the mind of the machines... Two blinding wormholers from Daniel Rozenhall on a super limited pressing bound to be sought-after by intrepid sound explorers. A close associate of Stockholm’s EMS studios and the Fylkingen venue at the heart of the city’s experimental music scene, Daniel Rozenhall has played a low-key but vital role in Sweden since his trio of albums for Firework Editions and Kning Disk, and the ‘Rozenhall’ compilation, between 2001-2009. Ten years later he now metes out the mind-bindingly dense and absorbing audness of ‘Den Förföljdes Gryning’, unfurling some of the most colourfully kaotic and amorphous sounds this side of Merzbow, Florian Hecker and Cam Deas - and we do not use those comparisons lightly! Gifted with a remarkable taste or tolerance for high-strength hallucinogenic electronics, Rozenhall delivers two powerful tracts of unfathomably complex, polymetric slosh and scree riddled with amorphous, phantasmic apparitions set to trigger myriad, pareidolic perceptions. The first side is a glut of dissonant, alien squabble seemingly moving in every direction at once, somehow matching the crispness of Florian Hecker with the density of Masami Akita compositions in bewildering fashion, whereas the B-side inverts that complexity with a warped, elemental simplicity, allowing a single, oscillating synth figure to spiral out from low frequencies to high with a warped keen, recalling one of EVOL’s mentasm sculptures as much as Cam Deas in infinitely accelerating freefall or a creature that just crawled up the gullet of Organum. No compromises. Rozenhall properly sees this one through. less"

   "name": "Quite possibly the greatest computer game soundtrack of all time, Yuzo Koshiro’s Streets of Rage II proves the ubiquitous reach of rave music in ’92 with some 25 tracks of 16-bit house, techno, and breakbeats bound to trigger punch-drunk bouts of nostalgia with a certain generation of goggle-eyed gurners. We haven’t played the game since we were nippers, and to be honest don’t really remember the soundtrack being quite so mental and rushy, but the evidence speaks otherwise, sandwiching the usual jazzy Japanese schmaltz along with some ridiculously funked-up rave numbers clearly influenced by NYC techno, UK bleep & hardcore and Italian piano house. As ever it’s always impressive how much detail early game composers managed to juice out of those 16-bits of capacity, and this has got to be one of the nuttiest, most influential examples - pivotal, even - considering just how many homes across the world would have owned a copy in their living rooms and bedrooms. less"

   "name": "Thomas Ankersmit, last seen on a pair of excellent albums for PAN and Touch (in 2011 and 2014, respectively) pays tribute to legendary Dutch composer / electronic and tape music pioneer Dick Raaijmakers with an extended study in electronic music, utilising Serge Modular feedback and sine/pulse/random generators, contact mic, and tape speed variation to mirror some of Raaijmakers’ deeply weird experiments. As the label so eloquently explain - despite the abstract nature of the material, a sense of loss somehow pervades. Raaijmakers is a genuinely legendary figure in the history of electronic music, and Thomas Ankersmit’s fitting homage lands almost five years to the date of his passing, aged 83, in September 2013. Replete with experiments with sounds not found in the music, but generated by the listener’s own ear as a strange side-effect, this extended piece re-contextualizes Raaijmakers’ ideas about composition and spatial experience to focus on the sounds of raw electricity through creatively abused electronics, composing with analogue micro-sounds, and the three-dimensional sound fields; referencing storms, thunder, crashing and falling objects, and distant radio transmissions. The concept of the recording is directly inspired by Raaijmakers’ thoughts on “holophonic” sound fields to be individually explored by the listener. With this phenomenon, the listener’s inner ears actively generate sounds that don’t exist in the recorded signal, and which can change with a small movement of the head. In other words; it’s unlikely that you will experience this piece of music in quite the same way as anyone else, or that you will experience it that way more than once. And it’s perhaps this sense of transience; of not quite knowing whether what you’re listening to has a real, physical presence, or is a direct result of strange otoacoustic phenomena, that imbues this work with such unexplained melancholy. Listening to music borne out of conceptual curiosity, it's rare to suddenly find yourself staring into space, thinking about time, about the intangible essence of experience and beauty, of life itself. Homage To Dick Raaijmakers is an exceptional recording; approach with patience and care. less"

   "name": "Lakker find their voice on ‘Época’, remerging after a two year hiatus in which they explored solo projects, Arad and Eomac, to bend cues from John Cage, traditional Irish instruments, and the raw immediacy of Nyege Nyege Tapes to their noisy will “Following a restorative creative break to pursue their own solo projects (as Arad and Eomac respectively) the duo finally returned to the studio, finding themselves working more closely than ever before. \"We wrote this record together, in the studio as a duo.\" Ian explains \"Previous records involved a lot of time working on tracks individually, but Época was written almost entirely together in the studio - it felt much more fun, more organic and democratic.\" We allowed it to happen rather than push or pressure it\" Dara adds. The natural evolution of the tracks and their rougher, looser production sound parallels the duo's interest in two separate ideas: ambient and natural sound, especially the background noise - a sense of time and place - that is inherent in old recordings of folk and classical music; and an interest in herd dynamics and flock patterns / murmurations, both in the natural world and in human society. The movements which affect the world at large through cultural and political shifts. \"Like the first starling that causes a wave in a murmuration,\" Ian explains \"We are really interested in how this is also reflected in human society - a new idea appears and then reaches critical mass and resonates through society as a whole, and change happens (positive or negative).\" The rich and deep work of Época finds the duo reinvigorated from their hiatus, using their own voices extensively for the first time, alongsides regular vocal collaborator Eileen Carpio. As Dara explains \"We had been experimenting with our own voices in our solo music, so it felt like this was the moment to step out from behind the curtain and put our own vocals front and centre in a more natural way\". This leads to an at times more melodic and poppier feeling, balanced out by the off kilter rhythms and blasts of feedback and weathered reverbs that intertwine throughout the record. Once again the duo look to the outside world for sonic inspiration. Alongside the use of physical modelling synths the album contains recordings and samples of violin, guitar and bodhrán, the stringboard of a piano at EMS Stockholm, phone recordings of family gatherings in Dublin and 1970’s dance music from Jaipur.” less"

   "name": "The mothership has landed! Unseen Worlds finally deliver a premiere edition of Laurie Spiegel’s rare 1991 follow-up to ‘The Expanding Universe’ [1980], filling a gaping hole in electronic music collections across the known world The jaw-dropping ’Unseen Worlds’ was first released on CD in 1991 by Scarlet Records, but the label went defunct soon after, leaving Laurie seeing to any further pressings. She issued a 2nd CD edition on her Aesthetic Engineering label in 1994, but since that sold out, her amazing album has become very hard to find. Perhaps understandably, that scarcity is probably because nobody wants to sell their original copy, making this new pressing an invaluable window onto ‘Unseen Worlds’ in all senses of the phrase. In the years between her debut and sophomore sides, Laurie moved away from the New York new music scene to focus on other projects, most notably the MusicMouse software; an “intelligent instrument” allowing for greater real time automation of her equipment. MusicMouse for Macintosh, Amiga and Atari gained a lot of traction with rock artists and paid her bills, and effectively allowed Laurie up to focus on the aspects of music which interested her the most - improvisation and artistic process. Freed from the more laborious constraints of electronic music composition, Laurie’s artistic-technological breakthrough gave her greater tactility and control in the composition process. The result is some of the lushest and vivid electronic music you’ll ever hear. In the impossibly smooth pitch gradients and timbral complexities of the opening ‘Three Sonic Spaces’ trio, and the hallucinogenic harmonics of ’Sound Zones’ we hear the MusicMouse in blinding action, while the rest of the LP is no less impressive; leading us thru breathtaking black hole sonics on ‘The Hollows’; into mind-bindingly vast noise scapes on ‘Two Archetypes: Hurricane’s Eye - II’; while the shimmering beauty of ‘Riding the Storm’ are right up there with classics by Jean Claude Risset or Roland Kayn; and moments of exquisite beauty like ‘Strand of Life (*Viroid*) and ‘From a Harmonic Algorithm’ give way to the rarely paralleled scope of ‘Passage’, one of those epic electronic music works that makes wading through all the other stuff truly worthwhile. less"

All of the material was previously issued on tape only and has remained the preserve of collectors ever since, who know these recordings contain the seeds of some of industrial music’s greatest work. All recorded by Adi Newton on various tape loops, EMS synthi, electric violin and devices, with some assistance from Steven Turner (bass, treatments), D Tyme (guitar, treatments) and Simon Mark Elliot-Kemp (synths), the 4 discs are littered with glimpses of the band’s prescient, primal-futurist genius that would come into full effect on ‘White Souls in Black Suits’, their debut for Throbbing Girstle’s Industrial Records, that would force them into wider view of the nascent industrial network, and beyond the Sheffield scene they shared with the likes of Martyn Ware and Phil Oakley - Adi Newton’s former bandmates in The Future. From rawest drones to pulsing atonality and deeply eerie sci-fi styles that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Radiophonic release, the music is stark but sensuous, laced with a darkside northern appeal that could be attributed to the state of its bleak socio-economics - power cuts, cold war threats, Thatcher, Peter Sutcliffe - and which patently resonated with listeners across the world, leading ClockDVA to be ranked in the pantheon of post-punk/industrial musick’s most uncompromising and definitive groups. less"

Could this be one of the decade’s strongest disco/edit sessions? Aye. Funky buggers need apply! As Sound Hack, Soundstore, Sound Stream, and half of Smith N Hack with Errorsmith, Frank Timm is one of those rare European producers who can cut the mustard with disco edits. But we’re not talking half-arsed loop jobs that trim all the flavour - this guy is an absolute expert at turning old gold into precious new dancefloor gear - just ask any of the Detroit/Chicago legends like Theo Parrish, Anthony Shakir or Carl Craig, who’ve been playing his gear for decades now. Spelling out a definition of disco that takes Ron Hardy and Boo Williams styles for goalposts, Frank Timm’s music is made purely for the dancefloor. As such it’s always appeared on the DJ’s favoured 12”, but now ‘Soundstream’ clocks up next to his seminal ‘Tribute’ album with Smith N Hack as the most substantial set in his perfectly formed catalogue. Skipping between butterfly house and jerky disco, ‘Soundstream’ delivers some grade A heaters in the rutting Ron-style jag of ‘Get Down’, and with economically decadent string loops in ‘Spotlight’, while ‘Disco Advisor’ shoots good times from the hip, and the likes of ‘Love Remedy’ and the sexy synth lead of ‘Mercury Mood’ tend to deeper moments in an Ugly Edit manner, and the C-side’s uncredited number pays a knowing nod to Boo Williams and Glen Underground’s Maad classic, ‘Motion Sickness’.

   "name": "Theatrical late ‘70s synth music from Sweden, released for the first time by Dais \"Recorded between the release of Sand (1977) and Lost Secrets (1981), Symphonic Songs is a formerly unreleased work that chronicles the dynamic shift and development in experimental Swedish composer Ragnar Grippe’s canon. Following his seminal release Sand in 1977, Swedish experimental composer Ragnar Grippe worked on various art and performance commissions, often returning to Stockholm during the summer months to focus his efforts on his compositional practice. It was there at the famed EMS Studios where he began employing the Buchla synthesizer and the facilities multi-tracking capabilities as new instruments to map his mining of sound and movement. During the late 1970’s, Grippe formed a creative collaboration with choreographer Susan Buirge, specifically writing compositions for her works “Restes” and “Tamis”, thus pushing Grippe to start working in a more intricate studio environment. These passages inspired Grippe into a more complex layering process that focused more on placement and structure, rather than the aural floods and flourishes of his previous Sand album, eventually germinating in his first full 24-track composition entitled “Orchestra.” After debuting “Orchestra” in 1980 at the Electronic Music Festival in Stockholm, Grippe holed up at EMS Studios with those lessons and the fussy Buchla synthesizer, in which Grippe affectionately recalls “needed to be tuned and calibrated every 20-30 minutes.” He emerged with a new commission for Susan Buirge later formally titled Symphonic Songs and used in her avant-garde theater piece “Ci-Déla” which debuted in Paris in 1981. Symphonic Songs showcased Grippe’s sound au courant, pushing dense against sparse, calm into cacophonous, using each track as its own intersecting plane. Using the machinations of studio and structure to drive Symphonic Songs’ voice, Grippe culled a haunting, often cinematic electronic work that dots and darts into unexpected corners with curious aplomb. “Listen to the words, both terms have their root in classical music, but not in its form but because now I had so many more stems or voices that could be played simultaneously compared to my earlier pieces. Coming from a classical background, but with big nostrils for pop and jazz music, I can now see a thread in which classical got a new costume, dressed up in Buchla synthesizer and real bass sounds” Grippe says.” less"

Liam returns to Horo to follow up his second LP ‘Divination’ for the label in 2017 with the next step in his musical evolution - Navagraha. Navagraha means \"nine celestial bodies\" in Sanskrit. Each ‘Graha’ is a specific vibration and relates to the nine planets of our solar system, as well as the different parts of our body. In 1978 Hans Cousto, a Swiss mathematician and musicologist discovered the natural law of the cosmic octave as the link between different kinds of periodically occurring natural phenomena, such as the orbit of the planets, the weather, colours, rhythms and tones. For the Navagraha project Ancestral Voices has taken Hans Cousto’s ‘frequency’ of each planet and created a unique tuning system which he uses for each track.

The hours of studio work have resulted in making the band sound more confident and fully realised, reaching for and finding a sound that was perhaps unattainable 5 years prior. However, lurking behind the bigger vision and polished production, ‘Downer Edn’ is a complex proposition and remains a dark blast of an album. Expansive and cohesive, yet shimmering and rough; something they can be proud to call a definitive statement. As far as Australian punk is concerned, Downer Edition not only shatters the boundaries applied by that descriptor, it does so with the lushest attack conceivable. Like their (admitted) influence, the enigmatic Ohio legends of obscurity, V3, seldom has the f*** word been sung (repeatedly) in such a believable and poetic manner. The visceral pounding of melodies throughout the album transforms their inspirations; desperation, neuroses, trauma, survival, hooliganism, violence, hope, rejuvenation, and their hometown of Sydney’s full architectural and social scope - from a realm of intangibility to the very, very tangible. In the words of Mitch, \"We’re influenced by Sydney as a whole, whether it be the hot and muggy concrete streets of the West and South West, the \"glorious beaches\" of South Sydney, the racial tensions left over from the putrid Cronulla riots of 2006, the pompous and superficial fake tan/ bleached teeth combo suburbs of Bondi, as well as Sydney's iconography: The Harbour, the Bridge, the Opera House, Kings Cross. All the desperation embedded in and around these areas, including the eternal influx of troubled people looking to get into trouble, is our experience and main influence.\" Unified on ‘RBB,’ ruminating on ‘92’, chasing the escape on ‘Rave Slave,’ and unwillingly defiant on ‘Warrior,’ Downer Edition reaches past the wild ride of Dogging - this truly is the album that Low Life have been threatening to make for nearly a decade.\" Released in conjunction with Goner Records in the USA and Cool Death in Australia. less"

   "name": "Bay Area’s Ana Roxanne exerts a gently intimate and singular spin on new age ambient tropes, surely set to be hailed among this year’s finest quiet listening missives “Ana Roxanne is an intersex Southeast Asian musician based in Los Angeles. Born & raised in the Bay Area to immigrant parents, Ana's love for music and singing began through her mother's cd collection of 80's/90's R&B divas. Raised in the catholic church, she became a devout choir nerd and found any opportunity to sing, whether for religious mass, the jazz ensemble of her catholic high school, or karaoke at family gatherings. Her commitment to singing led her to a brief stint at a vocational jazz program in the cornfields of the midwest; in a remote town of 7,000 people, she began a formal study of jazz and classical music. During these years she would tour with various ensembles to beautiful old cathedrals in nearby cities and became enamored with the sacredness of choral music, as well as the enveloping sound of harmony. A near death experience, too, served as a connection between music and spirituality, and music as a healing art after facing tragedy. In 2013, Ana was also fortunate enough to spend a few months in Uttarkhand, India where she met an incredible voice teacher who introduced her to classical Hindustani singing. Living and studying with this teacher deeply impacted her outlook on the voice as art. It was there that she began to see the singer - the Diva - as a symbol of divinity; that the unique power of one's voice comes from the vulnerability of using the body as an instrument. Be it romance, love, or worship of a deity - in order to access such depths of emotional expression, one must be willing to be intensely vulnerable, lay one's heart in the open air, expose what is kept hidden. This brief study was the catalyst that led her to finish her music study at the experimental Mills College in Oakland, CA, where she began to combine all of these influences into her current self-titled project. This album ~~~ was created during her last years residing in the Bay Area, a tribute to the great musicians who inspired her and the landscape where she spent her formative years. In addition to the worship of R&B and pop divas, Ana's current practice explores themes of gender & identity. In October of 2018, she decided to come out publicly as intersex, and is dedicated to being a voice for her community and speaking out about social justice for intersex youth.” less"

Consciously or subconsciously. Feelings you want to be feeling or “should” be feeling but you can’t because your body won’t let you. Because maybe it knows it’s not safe for you. It’s when you reach that moment which makes your brow furrow because your chest is getting hot and something is about to erupt. When the feeling starts crawling up your neck, choking you, and you could try to make it stop but maybe it’s better for you if you don’t. When what comes out is painful - it’s tragic, it’s crippling. But with it comes a sliver of beauty. It’s burning and it’s stunning. When it’s over, you may learn by staring at the embers.” less"

   "name": "The endlessly inventive Matmos keep abreast of the game in ‘Plastic Anniversary’, their hugely playful and charming follow-up to ‘The Marriage Of True Minds’ [2013] One of modern dance music’s original deconstructionists, Matmos bring a long and mazy history of conceptualised sonic rearrangement to the table in ‘Plastic Anniversary’. As precedents for the current wave of dance music astringents, they maybe have a lot to answer for, but likewise they also lead the way with their fundamentally rhythm-based style inside, using the most ubiquitous of materials - plastic - to shape a ruck of highly personalised and unconventional songs. “Taking the concept of “broken beat” literally, “Breaking Bread” is a bouncy digital dancehall number built entirely out of the plucked and twanged fragments of broken vinyl records by the Seventies soft rock group Bread. A mini-suite for plastic container, exercise ball and an amplified DNA kit that recalls both 80s pop and the hectic minimalism of Michael Nyman, “The Crying Pill” stacks frantic patterns of saxophone-like sobs onto deep sub bass stabs that are almost trap. Amplifying squishy synthetic human tissue created by the SynDaver corporation as a substitute for human corpses in medical schools, “Interior with Billiard Balls & Synthetic Fat” pairs squelchy electro made out of gross-out substances with tangy melodic riffs. This odd combination of Cronenbergian body-horror and sunny grooves continues on “Silicone Gel Implant”, a skanking number that works rubbery basslines out of, yes, a breast implant, but by the time the plastic flutes snake into the mix, the source becomes secondary to the trance-like form. Side one closes in a more reflective and somber key, with the title track “Plastic Anniversary”, whose cod-medieval martial drums and horn fanfares recall Matmos’ penchant for anachronism circa “The Civil War” before giving way to a close-mic-ed cascade of plastic poker chips. If side one is playful and poppy, side two is sharper and darker in its implications, and features more live drumming than any other Matmos album. Things kick off with “Thermoplastic Riot Shield” a single-object study built entirely out of the sound of a police riot shield being stroked, rubbed and struck. The resulting sounds are processed into a tense assemblage of harsh noise, deep dub basslines and jarring cuts of silence. On a squeaky loop straight out of a Jacques Tati film, “The Singing Tube” draws out the pinging resonance of a ten foot long PVC pipe played entirely with plastic toilet brushes, and hits a flanged overtone effect not unlike the string compositions of Arnold Dreyblatt. Bristling with whistles and noisemakers and plastic-gloved handclaps, “Collapse of the Fourth Kingdom” bolts a percussive showcase for the high school marching band playing the signature patterns of drumline and Baltimore club onto jarring edits of LEGO bricks clicking into place and weird smears of processed plastic horns. Since plastic was described by its first developers as a “fourth kingdom” beyond animal, vegetable, and mineral, this track heralds the eventual collapse of the political economy that birthed the oceans of garbage that now choke our world. Thinking the dystopian consequences of plastic through to their post-human conclusion, the final track, “Plastisphere” sounds like a field recording of insects and birds and pattering rain and ocean waves, but is in fact a work of digital sleight of hand: every single sound on this track has been artificially constructed out of samples of bubble wrap, Velcro, plastic bags and straws and, tellingly, an emergency stretcher. After a volatile and vibrant suite of poppy plastic electronics, Plastic Anniversary ends in an acknowledgement of the planetary price yet to be paid.” less"

The smallest disturbance could sway the entire system out of order. This idea of a circular motion was at the center of the recording process and is also reflected in the artwork which resembles a topographical view of a closed natural habitat. Kilchhofer and Anklin draw inspiration mainly from their rural surroundings, mountain landscapes where natural overtones and stumbling rhythms navigate through high plateaus and velds to stony ravines and wooden trails - on a never ending quest for an \"ur-klang“; a primordial, ancestral music.” less"

Very little we’ve heard in 2018 has affected us as much as this elusive, magical record. In four pieces recorded at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, it’s the characteristics of the room itself that add a crucial dimension to these pieces, sounding worlds away from the cavernous reverb associated with church acoustics. Instead, these dry recordings bring out all the fragile warmth and intimacy that’s rarely associated with this multi-faceted, sacred instrument. Removed from its traditional, godly environment - the effect is startling. The magick also lies in Kali's capacity to produce rich, swirling, gaseous overtones. There’s a preternatural sensitivity toward these peripheral sounds, coaxing intoxicating spectrums of quivering hi-register fluctuations and sonorous bass at a pace that draws the listener in and seems to reduce everything around to a meditative serenity. Organ Dirges stands in a line of records borne out of serendipity rather than any planned, grandiose gesture. Recorded more or less off the cuff over just a few days onto a portable zoom, it’s a testament to Kali’s compositional instinct that these 4 pieces sound so resolved and purposeful. Every small detail sounds intentional without being controlled, right down to the almost unbearably moving disintegration at the very end of closing piece 'Fifth Worship’, like a slow descent into darkness. It’s interesting to note that Organ Dirges was first played at a huge iron mine, the acoustics once again altering the perception of these alchemical pieces. Indeed, we can attest to the contrasting experience we’ve had playing this record in different spaces - on headphones, quietly at night in small rooms, loud on monitors in large spaces - always revealing something new, always transporting us somewhere else. An incredible, uncanny record. less"

Includes beats by Explicit, JT The Goon, Proc Fiscal, Sir Pixalot, Mr. Virgo, J Beatz, TC$ and many more \"London to Addis is a pioneering Grime instrumental compilation, combining for the first time traditional Ethiopian instruments and an all-star line-up of Grime producers. The release covers the full spectrum of the Grime sound - from the direct percussive bangers of Dexplicit, Ignorants, J Beatz and TC4, melodies of JT The Goon, Wize and Shudan, to the more experimental and abstract sounds of Proc Fiskal and Captain Over. The aim of the project was to bring together the two very different worlds of Grime and traditional Ethiopian Music and explore what can be created by fusing these two styles and exchange knowledge. Traditional Ethiopian music uses pentatonic scales and different time signatures which inspired the Grime producers to explore and experiment outside of their comfort zone. Tracks such as Ignorants - Uncolonised - the first 3/4 time signature Grime track pays homage to some of Ethiopia's traditional styles and rhythm, whilst incorporating them into a Grime sound. Recorded over a week in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, the instruments used are just a small sample of the huge range of Ethiopia's rich musical heritage which remains largely undocumented outside of the country. Whilst the music of west-African music from countries such as Ghana and Nigeria are more well known in the UK, Ethiopia's music uniquely combines both African and more Arabic sounds and rhythms as a result of its proximity to the middle east. The 4 instruments recorded were the Masinko, Krar, Washint, Drums as well as traditional vocalists. The Masinko is a single-stringed fiddle made from horses tail and hide that is throughout Ethiopia by several groups, including the Amhara, the Tigreans and Oromo. The Krar is a traditional 5 stringed lyre. Different techniques such as bowing, strumming and plucking can be used to create a variety of sounds and tones.

The follow-up to IVVVO’s ‘Good, Bad, Baby, Horny’ sees him unpackage and build upon that EP in all directions at once in a viscerally corporeal and sorely emotional salvo intended to be taken as his definitive opus to date. Across its 15 songs the London-based, Portuguese producer spells out a narrative as vividly hypermodern as a Nicolas Winding Refn flick but set in the fashionista underbelly of London, with crucial assistance on two of the album’s highlights coming from soundtrack composer and ‘Hollywood Medieval’ producer Maxwell Sterling. Like a magpie with fancy taste, IVVVO picks the shiniest and most affective elements of contemporary dance/rock/pop and electronica - from deconstructed trance synths to blockbuster sound design and choral arrangements - and then weaves them into searing, reactive expressions of modernity. The results are skizzy, veering from anxious to ecstatic and often in the space of one song. Kicking off with convulsive samples of Korn’s Jonathan Davis wedged into the nerve-jangling opener ‘This is Dog’, the LP bleeds with emotion at each step, from the heart-bursting Lorenzo Senni-esque style of ‘Life’ to the clenched and knotted grunge reflux of ‘Forever Your Mouth’ to the visceral, Arca-like incision of ‘Blade’, while two pieces with Maxwell Sterling, the Coil-like arabesque ‘Untitled’ and the vertiginous flight of ‘Last Days’, seal the deal with decadent flourishes. less"

Hyped after partnering with All City for Knxwledge’s \"Wraptaypes\" project back in 2015, they initially set out to put together an EP but as the tracks kept coming in it exploded into the sprawling double LP of low-slung grooves and bangers from the best in the business. With everyone on the record being a friend or friend of a friend, the comp just kept growing as GD went to work with the hustle he has learned from penning his post-it sketches day in day out for the last decade. Word spread fast and soon he was being sent beats from all over, even reaching behind the prison walls of Bergen County Jail, New Jersey and securing a track from former Dipset affiliate Max B. The last few years have been busy for Marlon \"Gangster Doodles\" Sassy. He released his acclaimed Gangster Doodles (The Book) alongside an ever-expanding array of prints, original works, apparel and exhibitions across the globe. Topping that off with animation projects, a graphic novel in the works and now, with this LP titled \" Gang$ter Music Vol 1\", he is about to debut his first ever music compilation. He says himself: “Every time a new track came in it was like running down the stairs on Christmas morning to open a present. What started as a slow trickle of work coming in soon turned into a tsunami with some of my heroes like Onra, House Shoes, Blu, Jeremiah Jae joining up with young guns Kojaque, Kean Kavanagh, Dream Panther and others to beef up the record” “When an email pinged through with a track from brothers Oh No and Madlib it felt like the final gift and Gang$ter Music Vol. 1 was complete.” less"

   "name": "Alvin Curran’s enlightening 1982 masterpiece for voice, synth and tape is back in circulation with thanks to the wonderful Blume label, who have already provided us with vital avant-garde beauties from Mary Jane Leach, Julius Eastman, Sarah Hennies and others. As co-founder of the pioneering Musica Elettronica Viva improv ensemble formed in Rome, 1966, Alvin Curran was instrumental in the development of electronic and avant-garde music during its golden formative phase, and his influence has resonated throughout many strands of new, experimental music ever since. Curran’s 3rd solo album ‘Canti Illuminati’ [1982] is regarded by many as a shining example of his work, bringing to light his focus on “joining notions of place, time, with personal and collective experience,” and typically striving for a natural form that most beautifully transcends perceptions of what avant-garde music is and can be - especially when compared with the genre’s more atonal and “difficult” offerings. Earthbound but beatific, ‘Canti Illuminati’ is written in two parts that speak to ideas about individual and collective voices. His piece for ‘Voice, Synthesizer and Tape’ sustains some 27 minutes of overtone singing and extended vocal techniques, layered with ship horns, railroad rhythms and imperceptibly woven Serge Synth electronics that become more apparent as it unfolds. You’ll be transfixed from the outset by its complex coordinates, pointedly pulling the senses in various directions, but a certain denouement occurs midway and it gets deeply weird when Curran’s own, tape-delayed voice gathers into a swarming murmuration buoyed by a slowly rising proto-Autechrian bass tone that carries it to visionary new heights. Where that first piece is about disparate sources - natural and mechanical - arriving at a singular complexity, his work ‘For Choir, Synthesizer, Piano And Tape’ follows with a chorus of 11 voices alternating between solo flights of fancy recalling Ghédalia Tazartès in full voice, to more measured, massed harmonies that speak to a more ancient sorts of psychodrama, like mythical Greek chorales rupturing the present and tracing the event-horizon of a cosmic black hole that separates us from from myriad parallel dimensions. We’re only just pulled back from the edge by a pastoral piano and literally indecipherable but beautiful vocal emoting and intoning in pure glossolalia as entrancingly otherworldly yet innately human as Finnish yoiking or Mongolian overtone singing. This is one record you can take on trust from accreted generations of ears - it’s a genuine, timeless masterpiece. less"

   "name": "The final release from The Caretaker (1999-2019). The Caretaker provides closure to a 20 year-long act that has uncannily lurked in the shadows of so many of our listening lives. Clad for the last time in Ivan Seal’s specially commissioned artwork, ’Stage 6’ sees The Caretaker mirroring the ultimate descent into dementia and oblivion, using a patented prism of sound to connote a final, irreversible transition into the haunted ballroom of the mind that he first stepped into with 1999’s ‘Selected Memories From the Haunted Ballroom’. This final dispatch is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most immersive and intangible of his two-decade arc. Invoking Jack Nicolson’s caretaker in Stanley Kubrick/Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’ as metaphor for issues revolving around mental health and a growing dissociation/dissatisfaction with the world, the project really took on new dimensions in 2005 with the 72-track, 6CD boxset ‘Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia’, which was accompanied by an insightful unpacking of its ideas by cultural critic Mark Fisher aka K-Punk; a stalwart of the project who identified it (alongside music from Burial and Broadcast) among the most vital, emergent works of Hauntological art - a form of music often preoccupied with ideas about memory and nostalgia (but one distinct from pastiche), and the way that they possibly overwhelm, occlude, or even define our sense of being; ideas that resonate with Fisher’s own assertion that capitalism essentially undermines collective thought, distorts the individual, and has tragically lead to a worldwide increase or even ubiquity of mental health-related issues. By using fusty samples from an obsolete analog format, and by doing so in the 2nd decade of the 2nd millennium, The Caretaker perfectly and perversely bent ideas of anticipation/expectation with his arrangements, playing with notions of convention and repetition with effect that would lead some listeners to wonder if the same record was being released over and again. When combined with Ivan Seal’s bespoke painting for each release from 2011’s ‘An Empty Bliss Beyond This World’ onwards, the project crystallised as a real gesamtkunstwerk for these times, and one arguably defined by a stubborn and intractably chronic drive against the grain of modern popular culture, or even a refusal of it. And so to the project’s final goodbye. Drifting from the silty departure of ‘Confusion so thick you forget forgetting’, thru the smudged anaesthetisation of ‘A brutal bliss beyond this empty defeat’, and the abyssal, distant echoes of ‘Long decline is over’, to the increased pauses that punctuate the final side’s piece, ‘Place in the World fades away’, it eventually leads to a final coda that breaks the fourth wall. Here, with the outside world muted and only the timbral residue remaining like smoke, everything moves as slow as a Lynchian dream sequence - until a conclusion so ineffably sublime occurs that we can’t mention it for fear of waking up. less"

   "name": "Maria Minerva beautifully honours the memory of her collaborator Chelsea Faith Dolan, a.k.a. Cherushii, who was among the 36 people who died in the Ghost Ship fire in Oakland, 2016. Posthumously issued, the six songs of ‘Cherushii & Maria Minerva’ were written by Maria and her departed collaborator after they bonded during Maria’s first US tour, when they covered over 3000 miles playing 8 shows, including performances at venues such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Missoula, Montana, not usually known for fancy European music. Sadly, the fruits of their friendship weren’t completed before the tragic Ghost Ship fire, so Maria has enlisted the aid of David Last, Adam Gunther and Brian Foote (Leech) to faithfully finish them off and pay tribute to Cherushii. Their six songs are about celebrating the good times, with Maria’s dreamy vox floating over 100% silky trax in gorgeous style on the plush slink of ‘A Day Without You’, the decadent swing of ‘Boyfriend Shirt’, and the dusky deep house hustle of ‘Out By Myself’, while Leech chiefs in with feathered gamelan-like riffs on a more hushed, sweetly elegiac edit of ‘A Day Without You’. less"

   "name": "Bonkers Japa-knees-up, surveying Techno Menses’ party-starting ‘Requiem In The Sun’ and his crankier solo output, all originally issued on tape by the legendary DD Records between 1983-8 and repackaged as the first instalment of Vinyl-On-Demand’s Japan series Highly recommended for the Techno Menses side especially, it’s easy to hear why this 2LP kicked off Vinyl-On-Demand’s series of reissues from Japan’s ‘80s minimal/synth/wave and electronics tape scene. Sounding something like V/Vm and Bruce Haack playing a pie and pea super rave at Blackpool Ballroom, it’s a glorious, playful collection of organ and drum machine-driven jaunts that epitomise Japanese musicians’ sidespin on Western styles, while also locating a lesser-known root of what would become the infamous, virulent Japanese noise scene. To be frank, we’ve developed a small addiction to the unbridled joy and raw grandiosity of Techno Menses. Formed by Kimihide Kusafuka alongside Kazuhiro and Tomoya Sakashita, Techno Menses’ sound ranges from mutant dirges that sound like Soviet anthems, to dark redlit kerb-crawlers right outta some early James Ferraro fantasy, and best of all, a pair of wild surf rock/proto-techno jags with sing-song vocals. It’s these two. ‘Requiem in the Sun’ and ‘Lovers in the Sun’ that are pretty much worth the admission alone, especially to any discerning DJs with an up-for-it crowd. The other disc, meanwhile looks to Kimihide Kusafuka’s early solo work. Arguably similar to, but less boisterous than Techno Menses, the vibe of ‘Re-Musick/Demise Symphonika’ is more mannered but still riddled with flavour, coming like Klaus Wunderlich’s winking bastard offspring who plays cult Tokyo bars ’till late every night. Which should be all the more surprising when we consider that Kusafuka is arguably now best known as master of junk metal cut-ups, K2, subject of recent reissue on Hospital Productions. less"

   "name": "Closing the unoficial New Weird Portugal tape batch on Sucata Tapes is Eosin aka Diana Combo with a mixtape of crackling and droney vinyl mixed with Field recordings recorded outdoors on a later summer afternoon in Alentejo. In Diana's own words: ''This piece was made during a residency in Elvas (Alentejo, Portugal), in the context of the first edition of the festival A Salto, in July 2016. Each one of the invited artists for this residency was given a specific place where to develop a work to be presented during the festival. I spent a week at Fábrica Frutas Doces, a small “factory\" dedicated to the preparation and confection of prunes and plums in syrup. Some families have been linked to this sector of activity for several generations, as is the case of Luís Silveirinha family, the current owners at that time. Frutas Doces isn't the only factory of this kind but it is the only one operating exclusively in an artisan way. There, Luís and his only employee (back in the day the team of workers was larger) were cooking the plums, adding fire to the already high summer temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius. This has to be done when the plums are collected, preserving the fruits at their best, so there is no escape from hell. I recorded bits of our exchange of words while they were doing their job. At home, I worked with a collection of vinyl records and made a composition using ones and the others. It was like I was creating the tone, a certain voice of the space, a construction that becomes a new reality of it. Like a register of its possible soundtrack, one which means from the space and is crystalized by the manipulation I make over my perceptions of that place during that period. At the same time, I joined Beniko, a visual artist, for the creation of her performance to be presented as the opening of A Salto, and one thing influenced and inspired the other. The piece I have made was presented as a live composition using the pre-recorded bits, at the terrace of the Fábrica in a late afternoon that was surprisingly mild. I decided to name the recording of this piece For Beniko, as she was an inspiration and remains as a beautiful memory of the time spent in Elvas. Listening to the piece is a way to go back in time, relocate there and remember the period of its creation. Sounds can bring images, other sounds, feelings, smells and taste to memory in a way that is so acute and live, even when the material that documents that certain reality is a construction of it, quite afar from its figurative or realistic representation.''

   "name": "A spiritual and thematic companion of sorts to PAN’s breathtaking 'Mono No Aware', this excellent artefact from highly promising Berlin/London collective, C.A.N.V.A.S revolves around curious new musics by Object Blue, Ben Vince, Flora Yin-Wong, Ashley Paul, Ausschuss, Xao, Michael Speers and others, a hugely absorbing set that veers from new mutations of ambient-pop thru to electro-acoustic terraforming and expressive minimalism. The performance collective-turned-label’s 4th release surveys a broad range of ideas running the gamut from electro-ambient abstraction to percussive studies and wave songs, all underlined by a mutual, coherent search for novel sounds that question ideas of authorship in a shared pool of codified ideas and techniques. Where the label’s first two releases by project coordinators Olan Monk and Lugh O’Neill established sprawling vectors crossing ambient-pop, Actress-style greyscale iridescence, and dreamily disembodied voices, here they both play into a bigger, more complex picture, highlighting a wide spectrum of subterranean thought and composition within the context of electronic music. Listeners are encouraged to draw their own links between the disparities; Xao’s opening gambit ‘Quintal’ unfolds a beguiling translation from ghostly mechanical gulls and aerial turbulence to lush ambient and back, while Flora Yin-Wong’s ‘Murmures’ describes an ethereal, chamber-like mutation of traditional Chinese tones, while Michael Speers’ wormholing abstraction gives way to Ashley Paul’s bittersweet asymmetric ambient pop masterpiece ‘Sleep Walker’. Label cofounders Lugh and Olan Monk are next, respectively, with an Oval-esque glitch meltdown ‘Hot Mess’, and the curdled minimal wave dirge ‘Seph’, before Ben Vince’s sky-searching beauty ‘Fading in Panoramio’ holds your breath until the rawly expressive minimalism of object blue’s ‘Fourteen Boulders, Fifteen Stones.’ closes the set with a glassy, uncompromising take on prepared and disfigured percussion. ’Cipher’ is one of those rare compilations that exceeds the sum of its parts, focusing on how artists hold their voice within increasingly borderless and shared languages in new music. Those of you looking to discover some of the most interesting tributaries flowing into the contemporary scene right now would be well advised to dive deep into this one. less"

   "name": "Knockout album of smoky jazz-pop, cinematic strings and filigree electronics from Eiko Ishibashi, who comes off like Japan’s answer to Julia Holter in the uneasy hauntology of her 6th album opus. ‘The Dream My Bones Dream’ finds Eiko delving into her family history, following the death of her father, coming to terms with the discovery that he came of age during Japan’s occupation of Manchurian China in the 1940s, when his father - Eiko’s Grandfather - worked as a railroad man in occupied territory. The album is about imagining a past she never knew, and about how that past can inform the future - in particular her own. As a noted improvisor on percussion and piano, Eiko’s sense of intuition is key to her music, and ‘The Dream My Bones Dream’ would appear to be a study in locating or understanding the source of her core instincts. Over its 9 songs, she describes a journey of discovery and reflection in expansive, near-cinematic terms, loaning from her practice writing for theatre and cinema to shape an album enriched with subtle emotional cadence and tempered instrumental virtuosity. From the anxious dawn of dissonant brass smear in ‘Prologue: Hands On The Mouth’, her journey wends from the rustling chug of ‘Agloe’ and its sweeping emotive arrangement, thru the inquisitive jazz chords of ‘Iron Veil’, to the reflective pool of hovering organ in ‘Silent Scrapbook’, and the fleeting feels of anger and sadness in ‘A Ghost in a Train, Thinking’, before her timelessly sumptuous title track comes off like the sonic denouement of a classic film, and the pulsating electronics of ‘Tunnels To Nowhere’ signify a rush to the future, and the melancholy resolution of ‘To The East’, and the ultimate uncertainty connoted by swirling, bittersweet strings and tentative double bass in her ‘Epilogue: Innisfree’. less"

Traditional taarab music – the Islamic music of Zanzibar and the East African coast – had for a long time been influenced by Bollywood soundtracks, but Zuhura & Party were instrumental in bringing the focus back onto classic Swahili styles, at the same time introducing a new fast-paced and electrically amplified style known as chakacha that revolutionized the scene. Zuhura was not afraid of speaking out and her music - sometimes featuring risqué lyrics - dealt with contemporary issues from a female perspective, something of a rarity at the time and something that would pave the way for the new “modern taarab” sound that came to fore in the 1990s. The group played across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania throughout the 70s, and while playing a wedding in Nairobi in 1981 they were approached by the local Polygram studio to record an album - one of the only full-length Taarab recordings of the period. The record did not catch on as the LP format was not suited to the tiny portable record players in use in Kenya back then, and the record industry as a whole collapsed in the wake of the 1982 coup d’état attempt and the resulting economic slump. Only a few records were pressed and have since become much sought-after collectors’ items. Locally the songs survived and remained popular as pirated dubs (first on cassette now on CDR).\" less"

   "name": "One of the year’s most crucial wave reissues, Stano’s debut LP ‘Content to write in I dine Weathercraft’ is a seminal and sought-after Irish post-punk album starring two rare appearances by the near-mythical Michael O’Shea. Nothing less than an essential recommendation to anyone familiar with the Michael O’Shea LP, Finders Keeper’s ‘Strange Passion’ compilation, or early Dome experiments! We can barely contain our buzz over this reissue. From its wild DIY drum machine programming to the appearance of O’Shea’s cymbeline-like home-built instrument and the cut ’n splice, layered song arrangements, ‘Content to write in I dine Weathercraft’ is one of those blue moon reissues that, in hindsight, seem to blow away so much other, better known material from the era whence it came. As spotted with ‘Town’, a highlight of Finders Keepers’ great Cache Cache compilation, ‘Strange Passion’, Stano’s mix of hands-on drum machine rhythms and bittersweet songcraft remain among the strongest examples from Dublin’s punk/post-punk scene of the early ‘80s. And judging from the 2nd hand asking prices of ‘Content to write in I dine Weathercraft’ in 2018, quite a few other listeners are patently aware of his prowess, too. A former member of The Threat (also found on ‘Strange Passion’), John Denver Stanley or Stano recorded his first album in Dublin’s Alto studio, in the basement of late C.18th Irish Nationalist leader Robert Emmet’s house, where he made sublime use of the studio’s natural reverbs, inviting around pals and peers to work in a musique concrete-like method of playing, processing and editing to achieve the wickedly unpredictable, flowing chicanery of his first album. The two appearances of Michael O’Shea and his Mo Chara (a self-built, 17-string, zither or cymbeline-like instrument with pick-ups) are noteworthy not just for their haunting beauty, but also their rarity, amounting to the near-mythical busker’s only known recordings outside an eponymous classic for Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis’ Dome Records. Whether meshed with Stano’s drum machine and echoplex FX in ‘Seance of a Kondalike’ or layered with his Sitar and Stano’s tabla-esque tweaks in ‘A Dead Rose’, the effect leaves us a shivering mess, to be honest and still scratching our heads why there’s no recent, significant reissue of O’Shea’s own work. The rest of the LP is no less brilliant in it’s own way, roundly speaking to the diversity Stano, a self-described “non-musician”, and his intuitive way with sound. From the almost lusting funk of ‘White Field (In Isis)’, to the wild-pitching drum machine of ‘Blue Glide’, thru the icy elegance of the grand piano in ‘Out of the Dark, Into the Dawn’, to the sheer concrete sound design of ‘Melting Grey’ and again with that deadly machine swagger on ‘Emma Wild’ and ‘Room’, we’re left in no doubt this LP is a true, overlooked classic of its time.

   "name": "Julius Eastman’s breathtakingly powerful ‘Nigger Series’, recorded in 1980, available on vinyl for the first time, correcting an oversight that goes to the root of conversations about race and politics in contemporary music. Compiling ‘Crazy Nigger’, ‘Evil Nigger’ and ‘Gay Guerrilla’ together for the first time, they form a long overdue showcase of Eastman’s genius, an unmissable portal for anyone intrigued by this hugely compelling artist and his music. Julius Eastman (1940-1990) was a prodigious voice within the influential American avant-classical movement of the 1970s. As a composer, pianist, Grammy-nominated vocalist and dancer, he brought unique qualities to the downtown minimalist movement most commonly associated with Philip Glass and Steve Reich. But where their music has received no shortage of accolades, by the early ‘80s Eastman’s staggering compositional contributions during the same era were practically unknown beyond tapes circulated between his peers. As Bradford Bailey explains “His place within the context of American classical music - an uncompromising artist of inconvenient identity, rising on the tide of an unavoidable talent, was a threat to the institution’s walls. It’s no surprise that his efforts were forced into the shadows…” Thanks to Mary Jane Leach, however, a wider reappraisal of Eastman’s work began with release of his ‘Nigger Series’ as part of the 3CD ‘Unjust Malaise’ [New World Records, 2005], and the trio of works now appear on vinyl for the first time. ‘Crazy Nigger’ is the first and longest part of the series. Its provocative title was shocking then and is perhaps now more than ever. However, as the composer explains in an introduction given at Northwestern University found on ‘Unjust Malaise’, his use of the term references the fundamental role of “field niggers” in the foundation of the American economy, as “not superficial, but elegant… at the ground of things”. From this perceptive base, Eastman radically adapts the instrumental language of classical music to his own, expressive ends, to challenge the restrictions of romantic classical music with more fluid and organically open-ended musical structures. Composed in 1978, it offers a muscular parallel to the more mannered minimalism of the era. His keys attack in powerful flurries right from the start, cascading complex harmonies that arguably feel more immediate, gloriously voluminous and, heck, “crazed” than work by almost any of his contemporaries. By the track’s hammering climax and lofted conclusion, first time listeners will be under little illusion as to the thrilling power of Eastman’s playing and vision. ‘Evil Nigger’ follows suit with heart-racing intensity and blistering pace, with its four pianists, including Eastman, urged into spiralling frenzies by Eastman’s cries of “two, three, four”, while the piece escalates from tonal to multi-tonal colour with imperceptibly naturalistic quality, then decays into ether. ‘Gay Guerilla’ follows, relaxing the tension to connote a sense of the sublime, attempting to model in his music an empathy or kinship between downtrodden Gay and Black folk, and the PLO or Afghan army; people who were prepared to shed blood for what they believe in. The piece finds a devastating power in its relative reserve to the other two parts, with a finer, slower narrative quality pivoting around a musical quote from the Martin Luther hymn ‘A Mighty Fortress is Our God’, dramatically, and perhaps subversively, implying a call to arms. It is a tragic fact that Julius Eastman died aged 49, just over 10 years after these totemic pieces were written and premiered. In the time between, his work was neglected and his genius overlooked to the extent that he fell into substance addiction, eventually losing his accommodation and with it the vast majority of his scores and recordings. It would be at least 15 years before his music became known and available again, with Mary Jane Leach posting his remaining scores to the internet, leading to subsequent performances by ensembles across the world, and important reappraisals of his work by Black Music scholars such Jace Clayton and Kodwo Eshun. After the Frozen reeds label issued his Femenine set for chamber ensemble a couple of years ago, the world and the press at large finally stood to attention, with numerous features in too many publications and radio stations to mention following since. And as for these titles, perhaps Bradford Bailey puts it best: “You have to wonder, when titling his works - often deploying the vile language of racism and homophobia, if Julius Eastman was consciously forcing white, leftist music fans like myself to choke out words which we actively despise - to recognise polarising truths which are bound to his sounds and the context in which they reside - to see our complicity with unforgivable sin.\" less"

   "name": "After decades in the making Finders Keepers present the first-ever pressing of Serge Gainsbourg’s most elusive and coveted soundtrack studio recordings – co-written, arranged and orchestrated by the genius Jean-Claude Vannier (Histoire De Melody Nelson) during what many consider to be the dynamic duo’s most definitive creative period. Its the first time on vinyl for this previously unreleased Gainsbourg/Vannier soundtrack to a saucy, psychedelic gallic classic starring Jane Birkin and Gainsbourg in leading roles. Interesting for its forays into traditional sub-continental styles, and one track of heavy petting, alongside the usual Gainsbourgian string arrangements and smoky winks. Believed to have been lost in a studio fire by Gainsbourg enthusiasts for over forty years (a myth that also shrouds Morricone’s lost Danger Diabolik soundtrack) the misplaced master-tapes for the drug-fuelled/Mai 68 cash-in/road-movie Les Chemins De Katmandou have been widely considered the final audio jigsaw piece in an immaculate discography/filmography thus earning this soundtrack bone-fide Holy Grail status amongst the most avid disc detectives. Featuring the original crack team of Paris based players now recognised as French library music royalty, this LP epitomises the inimitable musical direction and expert psychedelic pop musicianship that graced classic Gainsbourg/Vannier soundtracks like La Horse, Cannabis and Sex Shop. Laying the stylistic, future-proof foundations for subsequent decades of forward-thinking Gallic funk mastery. Comprising Vannier’s signature recipe of thick plucked bass lines, close-micced drums, biting Clavinet and Eastern influenced strings and percussion (and a sprinkling of subtle traditional French instrumentation) the soundtrack to Les Chemins De Katmandou (aka The Road To Katmandu or The Pleasure Pit) captures Vannier and Gainsbourg in the first year of their creative partnership capturing their unique embryonic energy.” less"

   "name": "Unseen Worlds follow their amazing Laurie Spiegel reissue with a captivating album of avant, shaggy dog stories by Robert Ashley collaborator Sam Ashley and German instrument builder Werner Durand “I’d Rather Be Lucky Than Good is a new recording collaboration of Sam Ashley and Werner Durand. Sam Ashley’s mystic parables imbued with benevolent humor are drawn from a lifelong pursuit of a present-day shamanism. Werner Durand’s wind work on invented and traditional instruments stems from the minimalist tradition, routed through his own unique studies of obscure world musics. The two artists first met in Berlin in 1984 while Sam was touring Atalanta with Robert Ashley’s opera company, with whom he was a principle vocalist for many years. Sam Ashley’s work has appeared on other Unseen Worlds releases (J. Jasmine: My New Music) and in solo and collaborative performances alongside “Blue” Gene Tyranny and other artists across the world. Werner Durand, also active since the late Seventies, performs music for saxophones, Iranian ney, and self-made wind instruments. He is a linchpin figure in the experimental music scene in Germany and abroad following formative studies with Ariel Kalma and Gilbert Artman in Paris, Indian Classical Music with Kamalesh Maitra, and Iranian Ney with Ali Reza Asgharia. He has worked notably with David Behrman (Music With Memory), Arnold Dreyblatt (Animal Magnetism), Muslimgauze, Henning Christiansen, Catherine Christer Hennix (Born of Six), David Toop, and Amelia Cuni (Ashtayama, Diasporagas).

   "name": "Cult synthesist Novo Line re-imagines Philip Glass, Wang Chung and Jan Hammer’s ‘80s soundtrack work in a surreal, killer re-working of the musical atmosphere to the classic Qatsi trilogy and William Friedkin’s noir cop flick, ‘To Live and Die In LA’, made on era-specific Atari and Yamaha synths. Adored for his mathematically insightful explorations of mid-late ‘80s digital synths, Atari computers and MIDI tools, Novo Line’s music can be heard as a form of Hauntological archaeology; a persistent hunt for the ghost in the machine which irrevocably altered pop, dance and soundtrack music and helped shape western cultural consciousness since the advent of affordable home computers and synthesisers. On ‘To Qatsi and Die In LA’ he brilliantly delves into the soul of a Yamaha TX816 synthesiser which he acquired from American singer-songwriter Leon Russell shortly before his death in 2016. With the tone of Philip Glass and Wang Chung’s music and the inseparable imagery of Friedkin and Godfrey Reggio in mind, he coaxes out a sound that immediately connotes warmth and nostalgia, but, as ever with Novo Line’s music, there’s just something wickedly off in the music’s subtly curdled and ear-puckering tones, likely as a result of his favoured ancient tuning systems. The music plays out a cinematic montage of imagery associated with ‘80s crime thrillers - palm trees, pink and purple sunsets, shadows of venetian blinds on beige walls - in a way that uncannily emphasises the dreamlike nature of ‘80s synth soundtracks, and by turn ‘80s FM synth sounds, smartly highlighting their hold over contemporary psyches in the same way that warbling ’60s and ‘70s analog synth sounds did to previous generations. less"

Flowing from first moment to last, it's a bit of a benchmark release that not only serves as a testimony to one of the most treasured and beloved catalogues in all of electronic music, but also illustrates that technology really can be about more than just presets and self indulgance.

A massive RIYL Demdike Stare, Wasteland, Jay Glass Dubs, The Bug, Jon Hassel... Long in the works and properly worth the wait, ‘Devil’s Dance’ is a deliriously strong summation of Ossia’s singular style. Dread-filled and fevered, it marks the Bristol/Berlin-hailing producer as a master at negotiating negative space and bending styles to his will, taking what he needs from grime & dubstep, jazz, techno and post-industrial music, and warping it all with an uncanny sleight of hand that only comes from proper dedication to dub craft. Most brilliantly, nothing is square or regular in Ossia’s sound world. Edges are consistently smudged and slanted, sounds bleed into one another with organic form, but, like a backyard/spareroom ganja farmer, his skill lies in pruning punctuations, allowing his forms to grow wild, whilst knowing where and when to cut and splice. Now harvested, his crop is effectively a highly potent batch with a perfect balance of meditative and psychoactive content. From the gauntleted noise sculpture of ‘Concrete’, to the weightless skank and skronk of ‘Radiation’, thru the heaving masses of his ‘Devil’s Dance’ and ‘Hell Version’, thru the spectral ephemera of ‘Inertia’ and the 23 minutes of perceptive chicanery in ‘Vertigo’, you have one of the strongest dub records you'll hear for time. less"

RIYL Fatima Al Qadiri, Scott Walker, Omar Souleyman​... Profoundly original, but steeped in millennia of both Pre-Islamic (pagan) and Islamic theology and Arabic tradition, Dhil-un Taht Shajarat Al-Zaqum is a unique album no matter which way it’s approached. With a dramatic sense of purpose at the album’s core, its 11 songs propose a work of literary fiction that draws upon a rich knowledge of pre-Islamic and Quranic poetry. Myslma spells out a subversive take on existential angst, charting a transition from a romanticised childhood, thru the rising self-awareness of adolescence, to problems with parents and the sardonic cynicism of adulthood, before looping back to childhood, and resolving with a burned-out, sore conclusion. Naturally, anyone who doesn’t speak Arabic (or even classical Arabic) will have trouble comprehending the lyrics literally, but with thanks to the impassioned intonation of his vocals, and the connotations of his starkly evocative backdrops, non-Arabic speakers should have no problem grasping the album’s emotional pull. Whether channelling a sort of R&B/soul spirit in the aching delivery and floating chords of opener ‘Inqirad (Rihab-U Dhakir)’, singing from the middle of a weightless grime skirmish in ‘Min Bab AlKamal-i w AlDawam’, then floating on organ tones in ‘Hazat-u-L-Waraq’, or scaling the lofty heights of ‘Astaqi AlGhamam’, it's a unique and startling despatch. less"

Defying any one genre, she refers to her distinct sound as ‘Swamp Pop’. Unnatural sounds and pitches exhale in melodic chants, ominous baselines resound and eerie loops fixate in this macabre ensemble. You are captive in her world. Moments of haunting clarity keep you wondering where she will take you next whilst strange narratives unfold. Her chameleonic visual display is charged with emotion, keeping you suspended in a state of flux as she orbits through the spectrum. Stimulated by human behaviour and existence she questions the very nature of being, and invites the audience to explore through her cathartic performance.' To our ears, her sound captures elements of the radiophonic qualities by electronic pioneers such as Delia Derbyshire, through to unlikely melody and harmony akin to that of Ryuchi Sakamoto. Place this in a picturesque, weird & wonderful sphere, projected like an extra terrestrial, audio-visual soundtrack to Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Holy Mountain, and you’re half way there. Essentially though, her sound is a total world of it’s own. Hinge, E B U's debut album, is an outer body experience that will conjure up memories you never had before, images you can't quite place but somehow relate to, and a sense of sweet disorientation as you slip into a whirlpool of shapeshifting melody, harmony and frequency.” less"

Whirring, stops and starts of an eco espectral, may be musician trying to imitate, synthesize, the sound of a haunting, or a ghost itself trying to render the human voice. Lange often visualizes meeting strange beings, the odd encounters that occur in the creative process, a sound form of manipulation, in which who, or what is changing whom, becomes unclear.

The band was one of the first fully synth based groups, and as such were featured on the Some Bizzare Album alongside, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, Blancmange and The The. A brief history of the band includes the fact that as early as 1979 they performed in a show alongside the likes of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Cabaret Voltaire, Fad Gadget, B-Movie and Clock DVA, organised by the band and Stevo Pearce (Some Bizzare Records). The band undertook the Naked Lunch's 'Electronic Indoctrination Tour' in 1980 which included a show at Leeds Futurama Festival. Naked Lunch then set about helping Pearce find artists and recordings to make up the Some Bizzare Album to which the band itself contributed \"La Femme\" (a song originally called \"Le Femme\" but Phonogram who released the album was licensed to change it to the grammatically correct French, missing the point of the androgyny of the electronic music scene and that the song was about that).

Co-produced by Randall Dunn \"Alex Barnett (Champagne Mirrors, Oakeater, SCRAPES Recordings) and Faith Coloccia (Mamiffer, Mára) developed a friendship based on a fascination with the world just outside the limit of our understanding—the world where magic and mystery hold equal footing with science. On their third collaborative album VLF, the duo draft a soundtrack to the mapping of the unknown realms in both their private lives and the communal world around them. It’s a premise embedded in the album title, an acronym for Very Low Frequencies which help capture the oscillations of dark matter, as well as a misspelled nod to the VLA radar banks in New Mexico which serve to chart out the cosmos. This fixation on scientific pragmatism finds a creative parallel in the duo’s left-brain explorations of early electronic music, although the bigger influence in Barnett & Coloccia comes from the gaps in our understanding, where instinct drives our behavior and unseen forces impose their will on our surroundings, where certain frequencies inexplicably yield an emotional resonance and, conversely, subconscious impulse finds an analog in sonic patterns.

In these works I used the idea of the scalar field as a simple framework to experiment with time-based works that are not dependent on time when experienced. I wanted to explore slowing down video to the point that change was imperceptible and create sound with no attack or decay, only sustain. My intent was to create a time-based piece that could be experienced more as a painting or sculpture could: a static object that gains meaning though prolonged observation. I was interested in what would happen when the audience was given agency over their experience. As the series progressed, the concept drifted further and further from the title's formal association with math or physics––instead the framework developed a life of its own. This release documents the sound elements from two of the audiovisual installations in the series: Scalar Field (f9bf3b, fde3a7, 4183d7, 1f3a93) shown in Los Angeles in 2016 and Scalar Field (f89406, f2784b, f64747, f62459) shown at the Dancity Festival in Foligno in 2015. - Yann Novak” less"

   "name": "Wayside & Woodland task the endlessly inventive Richard Youngs to riff on the overlooked, prosiac world around him... While Youngs’ music perhaps remains an acquired taste (full disclosure: it took this writer years before he clicked, but when it did… it really did), his ‘Memory Ain’t No Decay’ statement is particularly accessible to both longer term disciples and newcomers alike. Given a list by the label’s Ben Holten (Epic 45) which reflects their ethos - including; ”Degradation of memory, decay, change, loss, the beauty of abandoned buildings and places, post-industrial wastlelands, 'edgelands', 'unofficial countryside', grass verges, woodland between housing estates” - Youngs divines a pathos in those arguably mundane yet modestly evocative images which many of us in the UK and elsewhere pass thru or inhabit everyday. Young sums up his approach most beautifully and succinctly as: “It’s about noticing the world, not trying to change it” and we could hardly agree more. While ostensibly mundane, prosaic, the listed zones and integers of transition have always prompted a fondness in us, and we hear that humble intrigue throughout the three works, from the plaintive, grey-skied krautrock-like repetitions littered with scudding, wistful vocals in ‘Edge of Everywhere’, to the strolling bluesy appeal of ’Still Learning’, and in the mesh of semi-pastoral strums and murky synthetic tones of ‘Not For My Eyes’. less"

   "name": "'Body of Work' is the long awaited retrospective collection from electro-punk Gods Nitzer Ebb. Debuting in 1984, the band's influence is hard to over-emphasise, counting Depeche Mode, Richie Hawtin, and Nine Inch Nails among their countless devotees. Nitzer Ebb began in Chelmsford, Essex in 1982, caught the ear of PWL producer Phil Harding in 1985 and soon after recorded two killer tracks: ‘Let Your Body Learn’ and ‘Warsaw Ghetto’. They came to the attention of Daniel Miller and recorded the classic proto-Balearic techno album ‘That Total Age’ (Mute, 1987), featuring classic tracks ‘Murderous’, ‘Join In The Chant’ and ‘Let Your Body Learn’. The album was followed by four more towering sonic and design classics ‘Belief’, ‘Showtime’, ‘Ebbhead’ and ‘Big Hit’. Nitzer Ebb went on to sell over 100,000 records in the States alone, touring with Depeche Mode and influence pioneering DJs and producers such as Richie Hawtin, Darren Emerson, Sven Väth, Helena Hauff, Objekt, DJ Hell, Tom Stephan and Danny Tenaglia as well as bands such as Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails. They split in 1995, performing rarely after that dateand in 2010 released the album ‘Industrial Complex’. Nitzer Ebb's proto-industrialism was constructed in such a raw, uncompromising way that listening to it now it has stood the test of time with a remarkable show of self restraint despite all the grandeur behind the cacophony at play. 'Join in the Chant', which is included on this record, is probably their most recognisable work and is still apparently a much loved Ibiza tune...go figure! less"

   "name": "Some of the greatest New Beat, Industrial/EBM and loner synth music you’ve never heard compiled for the first time ever in Dirk Desaever’s amazing ‘Collected 1984-1989 (Long Play)’ - all combed from a massive unreleased vault, painstakingly restored, by Geneva’s generous Musique Pour La Dans label. Featuring 16 previously unreleased/unheard cuts (save for one track off a rare 7”), ‘Collected 1984-1989 (Long Play)’ is the centrepiece of Dirk Desaever’s long-awaited reissue programme. It features a stunning haul of mid-late ‘80s Belgian music riddled with a uniquely playful, dark, sleazy and brooding character that we can’t get enough of. Variously known as A Thunder Orchestra, Danton’s Voice and White House White to OG ‘80s fiends, and more recently via choice reissues from Minimal Wave and Walhalla a.o., it’s under his own name that we get to hear Dirk Desaever’s most personalized and alluring work; ranging from beautiful bedsit synth dreams and sex dungeon-ready etudes worthy of Coil B-sides, thru to melancholic EBM and medieval proto-grime/techno. Collected, the results form something like an imaginary or lost soundtrack to a cyberpunk flick set in Belgium’s mix of old and shiny, futurist architecture. Opening with the beatless, baroque synth study ‘Orchestra 15’, the set oscillates in and out of the shadows from the wickedly resolving drum patterns of his cenobite jack trak ‘Talk About The Usual And Unusual Things’, to a creepily daft but brilliant ‘Medieval’ set dance sounding like Wiley gone pagan, thru to pulpy midnight synth cues such as ‘Dzjingle 9’ and the drugged-up robot swagger of ‘Ein Spielzeug’ and ‘Orchestra 10’. But, if we’re pushed for favourites, it’s the more romantic/dramatic arrangements that really get us here, namely the beautifully weightless ambient-pop soul of ‘The Same, Same Story’, also when he appears to channel Lewis auditioning for the Phantom of The Opera on ‘And Suddenly’, and no doubt the salty-sweet dance-pop jangle of ‘You Laugh With Every Little Joke’ which ends the set like an expertly picked closing credits theme. Very simply, fans of outsider synth music, lo-fi dance trax, the dankest EBM and proto-techno oddities will obsess over this LP - for us it’s already up there among the best reissues of the last few years. Unmissable. less"

Somerville draws on conventional folk forms alongside post-punk, traditional Irish motifs, starry eyed pop and hypnotic drones to create wholly original music that is a product of its environment. Somerville channels the wilderness of the Irish landscape through dense, ethereal soundscapes and bare boned percussion interspersed with ghostly vocals that are ever present and all encompassing, like crystalline glints of sunshine peeking through dark stormy clouds. The duality of darkness and light is at play throughout the releases seven tracks - comfort is found in heartbreak, solace in despair and quixotic wonderment in the infinite melancholia. Somerville lays her heart bear and invites you into it with tales of doomed romance, bittersweet love stories and longings of ‘home’, in both the physical and metaphysical sense.

   "name": "Finally, Belgian EBM legend and New Beat pioneer Dirk Desaever takes a well earned bow with ‘Collected 1984-1989 (Extended Play)’, the first in a trio of compilations sourced from knackered old tapes and faithfully brought up to scratch for new ears and eras by French/Swiss cooperative Musique Pour La Danse. Dirk Desaever is a key, standout character from that super fertile late ‘80s dancefloor period that ultimately morphed into European rave and techno. Over the past decade Dirk’s rare and sought-after gear as A Thunder Orchestra, Danton’s Voice, and White House White has variously cropped up on Minimal Wave and via re-edits from Mick Wills and Marcell Dettmann, yet this series is the first significant survey of Dirk’s work, revealing a hitherto unheard depth and breadth in the same manner as Musique Pour La Danse’s equally indispensable collections of Ro Maron gear, another pivotal producer form the same region and era. This LP focusses on the wickedly dark, minimalist, and cinematic trax issued under Dirk’s coveted White House White alias. Omitting a couple of obvious classics, the selection includes all three cuts from 1988’s ‘Disdain’ 12” - the Front 242-styled title cut, his cantering ace ‘Oddball Harry’ and the New Beat thriller ‘The House of My Master Holds Many Rooms’ - before digging deep into the treasure trove of his archive with the sci-fi-sampling nugget ‘Wolves & Owls’, before that gurning New Beat flavour comes strong in the sleazy glam of ’St. Moritz, Mallorca and Cannes’ and ‘Put My Fingers’.

I wrote it around the time I was finishing my philosophy degree. I had also come to a point where I wanted to make music that was more personal, emotional and conceptual than before. The inspirational point of departure from which everything developed was Stalker, the Tarkovsky film. A personal favourite, which also happens to explore many similar themes as my studies came to focus on: meaning and purpose in life, existence and our relationship to reality, the emotions that steer our existence... We are deficient creatures. Powerless and ignorant of reality as a whole, and unfortunately our characteristic existence makes us painfully aware of that. Reality is fundamentally hostile (or indifferent rather) and we are not well 'fit' to live in it. We try to deal with this through emotional means. We seek comfort for our deficiencies, a sense of purpose and belonging... In Stalker people who have exhausted all other means of comfort seek for a room that is rumoured to manifest our innermost desires. They have to journey through a place that disobeys all of our notions of reality, a place both unpredictably dangerous and welcoming to those who find nothing worth living for outside of it. While evading our grasp it offers understanding to the lost and solace for the burdens of existence.” less"

Using the Max Brand synthesiser (a rare, modified Moog) on one side, and a Rob Hordijk modular system alongside sounds of the port of Hamburg on the other, the recordings render Kubin at his most explorative and experimental, as opposed to his usually heavily concept-driven output. ‘Max Brand Studie IV’ was composed for 8 loudspeakers, arranged in a circle, and was recorded in the former premises of the Institute for Media Archaeology, Donau, Austria. Working with what he calls “the egocentric and stubborn Max Brand” synth, Kubin rigs the machine in a way that allows it to speak and develop a life of its own, conjuring 19 minutes of ghostly spectral tones and beating pulses that haunt the vaulted recording space with a naturally unpredictable, analogue logic that’s fascinating to follow. On the flip, ’T O P I A’ was composed for a 3-channel video installation by Josphin Böttger. Recorded at Hamburg’s Hammerbrooklyn Studios, it uses the Rob Hordijk modular system and sounds of the city’s massive port to concretely characterise a sense of space and place that resonates abstract-industrial-realism, following a similar logic of endless cycles of growth and collapse, sustain and decay, with perceptively poetic results. less"

   "name": "An unmissable introduction to unsung American composer Mary Jane Leach with Pipe Dreams, astonishingly her first ever solo vinyl release. Despite playing an instrumental role in NYC’s pioneering Downtown avant-garde community since the ’70s, Mary Jane is, unbelievably, little known beyond the US avant-garde. Now, following her production input to the issue of Julius Eastman’s Feminine for Frozen Reeds (and her liner notes for Unjust Malaise in 2005 for that matter), the two powerful longform pieces contained in the cannily titled Pipe Dreams are set to attract a raft of new ears to her absorbing psychoacoustic explorations. Recorded between 1984 and 1989, Pipe Dreams is only Mary Jane’s 3rd full solo release, arriving nearly 20 years since Ariadne’s Lament [New World Records, 1998] and 24 after Celestial Fires [Experimental Intermedia Foundation, 1993]. With a paucity of precedents to compare it to, it effectively forms the first time many will clasp ears on her music, and simultaneously illustrates the range of her sound - one side of spellbinding church organ interplay; one of gripping tonal discord - while also placing it within historical context amid the searching Downtown milieu of Julius Eastman, Arthur Russell, Arnold Dreyblatt, Ellen Fullman, Philip Corner, Daniel Goode, and Peter Zummo - most of whom she’s collaborated with at one point or another, either in Downtown Ensemble or guesting on their records. That communal spirit, a sort of antidote to the capitalist realism of individualism, feeds deeply into these two solo works. On the A-side, Pipe Dreams (1989) finds her communing with psychoacoustic spectres in a way that strongly predates Áine O'Dwyer's more recent investigations into acoustic phenomena for Penultimate Press, as well as resonating with the drone work of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela. Amid her precise, baroque figures, pulsing air and pealing microtonal partials, listeners are witness to the presence of plasmic atmosphere and sub-harmonic frequencies that flux and disperse in sublime antiphony, likely to turn your chosen zone of reception into a discrete, floating antechamber. In stark contrast, Mary Jane’s B-side, 4BC (1984) is a more visceral, biting piece for four clarinets, employing long drones within a constrained tonal palette, combining their raspy dissonance in a thick body of resonant sound that speaks to the idea of discord as its own sort of harmony - a way of appreciating the friction and difference between sounds as much as people, and recalling to some extent the pitching grip of Harley Gaber’s The Winds Rise In The North, or the grind of Tony Conrad. Hard to believe it’s taken until now for Mary Jane to receive at least some of her dues, but a real pleasure to finally immerse ourselves in her heavily meditative, distinctly singular world. less"

The music we have selected shows how musicians working with the label responded to a period of dramatic social and sonic change, charting the route toward the esoteric and spiritualised sounds that would dominate the deepest jazz of the 1970s. \"The Blue Note Record label needs little introduction. Musically, graphically and sonically iconic, the label created and defined the golden age of modern jazz on record. Founded in 1939 by German émigré Alfred Lion, the label's roster of artists is a litany of giants – Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Herbie Hancock and many more. With peerless musicians in the grooves, the legendary Rudy Van Gelder behind the boards, and graphic design genius Reid Miles creating emblematic artwork for every release, Blue Note – 'the Cadillac of the jazz lines' – was outstanding in every way.As ever, Blue Note had lit the path, and this new Spiritual Jazz collection shows that the progressive and underground jazz sound of the 1960s was not only the preserve of obscure artists and private pressings.

The celebrated Egyptian visual artist Maha Maamoun has created the album cover art, following her contribution to Salute the Parrot. \"There was a blessed thing about the process of making this record,\" Louca says of the sessions, held last year in Stockholm and featuring the leader on guitar and piano. \"The dynamic between us musically but also as people ...What these musicians delivered was really more than I could ask for, Everyone played their hearts out on this record.\" The music-from its pensive lulls through its stretches of hard-grooving hypnosis and moments of avant-jazz catharsis-testifies to that rapport.

Where those early 12”s and follow-ups for Collapsing Market, City-2 St. Giga, TTT and Cititrax veered between mutant dance music, ambient asides and psych rock dérives, his new album is similarly prone to diversity of stricture and feel, but it’s also his most closely themed set to date. The array of modular misshapes, post-industrial noise and spectral electronics in ‘La Maison De La Mort’ conjure imagery connoting forests of concrete tower blocks, numb faces and spasms of cold Russian spirit that keenly lend themselves to comparison with a soundtrack for an unmade Tarvoksky or some poverty porn documentary like Vice’s ‘Krokodil Tears’. Breaking down into two distinct sections, the first plate obliquely sets the scene with a more fractious push and pull of cold, angular modular twangs and asymmetric rhythms, leading into starkly compelling dimensions with pieces like ‘FFF’ and the clangorous ‘GF-1’ subsiding into frazzled-nerve electro on ‘Synthetics’. By contrast, the 2nd plate is almost warm, evoking a more romantic sci-fi aesthetic thru the furtive ‘90s sci-fi feel of side C’s ‘Moscow Ambience’, ‘Octa Amb Plucks’, and ‘Moon Pad’, and side D’s beautifully strung-out ‘Flights’. less"

The B-side is more synthed-out, with impressive pieces including the lilting ‘Green Chaos’ of Helen Ripley-Marshall and the rustic psychedelia of Rainbow Generator’s ‘City Of The Sun’. “For musicians inhabiting the Antipodean countries of Australia and New Zealand during the 70’s and 80’s, it was a geographically and culturally isolating environment. Boutique shops, community radio and mail order exchanges championed independent and contemporary music from across the globe. It was, however, this isolation that caused a number of small community-focused scenes to evolve, creating their own unique interpretation and reappropriation of outside influences. Through both these scenes and government initiatives, a vast amount of music emerged on self-released and independent labels. Yet, even among small scenes that were creating unique sounds, a number of artists seemed to be making music that was neither here nor there, often meshing together numerous genres and influences to create anomalous sounds. Artists like Olev Muska along with Ingrid Slamer meshed traditional folk songs of their Estonian heritage with cutting edge computer technology. Ngahiwi Apanui used his native language of Te Reo and a “cheap drum machine” to create a pulsating tale that highlights the creation of Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand); while the Free Radicals would sing through PVC pipes to construct their vision of post-apocalyptic tribal music. Sydney’s Nic Lyon used his classical training to craft a distinctive gem which matched eastern and African influenced instruments with syncopated drum machines, while artists like Delaney Venn and Toy Division managed to challenge their post-punk sensibilities by blending both dub and atmospheric sounds respectively.” less"

   "name": "Dream collaboration between Jonny Nash and likeminded ambient soul, Suzanne Kraft Produced in 2016 and “in close proximity to the M56 Motorway”, which, weirdly enough, lulls me to sleep every night. We’d imagine that Passive Aggressive is intended to do the same thing, operating at such lowlit and hushed levels that it’s almost hard not to be seduced to slumber by its sandman tones. It really is best consumed whole, but if you’ve got a shorter attention span or need some highlights, check for the deliciously off key tone of Small Town and the ambient jazz nocturne, Hanging Glass Structure and you’ll instantly know the vibe. more"

The Chi Factory would like to give special thanks to his good Patmian friends Ulf Knaus and Nikos Eliou, who showed us his house on Patmos (everything is still the same since he left) and also his favourite old wooden door (see leaflet). His great minimalistic poetry became a source of inspiration for the Mantra Recordings. His life on Patmos was far away from public attention - quiet and always surrounded by the skies, seas, cats and birds. Lax was a real dreamcatcher.” less"

That means everything from OG SoYo bleep and Cornish acid to Detroit electro and Italian electronics get referenced in-the-mix, generating slippery mutant highlights across the board from the nippy clip and strobing arps of ‘Matryoshka’ and the joyous Italo-electro chuff-on ‘Excited, Boy’, thru the darkside electro burn of ‘Ghzel Tea’ and the glorious astral IDM projections of ‘Lezi’ with Happa, thru to the curved air of ‘Vennsate’, the curdled, mercurial flow of ‘Seize’, and the acrobatic complexities of the album’s lush title tune.

The mercurial, industrial pop fetishism of ‘Raging Tender’ forms the 3rd and most impressive EP from producer Jan Grebenstein and vocalist Christine Seefried for Karl O’Connor/Regis’ Downwards label. Stepping on from 2016’s ‘Strong Proud Stupid and Superior’ LP, Grebenstein’s sound is now tauter, more spacious and seductively strung out, finding a sublime tension between quicksilver slow/fast drum programming and deadpan gothic delivery. Their means of production is still bare-bones minimal in an economical Berlin style that has served the duo very well thus far, from their self-titled debut for Downwards in 2014 thru to more recent outings on experimental D&B labels Horo and Osiris Music UK. Title cut ‘Raging Tender’ zips up fanged arps and needle-toothed hi-hats under Christine’s close mic’d vocal with hypnotic poise and force, before ‘Breathe’ diffuses and unlocks that anaerobic tension with tantric 808 rhythms. After lulling listeners into a false sense of security, ‘Arab Icon’ raises the heart rate again with jarringly atonal electronics and an unyielding rhythmic grip, while the title and feel of ‘Body Electric’ speak to the duo’s most prurient desires, with Christine’s opiated, any-hole’s-a-goal mantra of “I Sing The Body Electric” set to knackered, bummed-out pads and oozing bass. These are uncompromising, virulent songs about sex, death, and dancing that will surely resonate with knowing connoisseurs of the contemporary darkside. less"

Sound design, industrial pulls, trap hihats open and close, autotune falls in and out *gasping*, painting a portrait of an all together modern heartbreak.

The results are superb, some of the most straight-up but effortlessly different takes on UK rap, garage and house in recent memory, sharing much in common with the modest but vital vibes of Coby Sey, Mica Levi and Tirzah, as the likes of The Streets. Production is handled by Archie Marshall on the first four songs, including the standout segue from woozy P-funk to R&B strut in ‘Tropical Bleu’, again on the Bugz In The Attic blue step of ‘Honey’, the jazzy curl of ‘Ceasors’, and the Burial-esque 2-step dipper ‘Nightcrawler’, while he capably goes it alone on the jazzy garage gauze of ’Sunday Smokes’, and all his pals jump in for the skippin’ London soul of ‘City Limits’. less"

We are long game lifers with no fear, no regrets and plenty of gratitude for the way the universe has rewarded our singular dynamic.\" Royal Trux find innovation in their 'Bitches Brew' aesthetic which now defines the standard mash-up approach so commonly ascertained and claimed by the majority of musicians that whether cognizant or not have followed in Trux's very large footsteps: \"everything in the pot whether you like it or not,\" deriving from world music, punk rock, jazz, metal, electronic, southern, teeny-bop and all the rest.

Their return is nothing short of glorious. \"It's funny how the outside world perceives or feels compelled to parse complicated relationships and dynamics...Usually it's an all or nothing game\", muses Herrema. \"This next chapter is just another perfectly aligned bit of kismet. No concerted effort to force anything forward or to create something with an eye on the past.

This has been a continued pursuit starting with my tape experiments in the 1970’s until the present, with technological evolution driving new ways of expression. With the exception of Xé May, which is performed on an Elektron Octatrack, these pieces were constructed for live performance using a laptop computer running programs I have built in the MAX programming language. Okajouki and Xé May were composed in 2011, all the rest are from 2018. The pieces use a technique of time slicing that I first started doing back in the 90's, notably with my piece MOM's, wherein sound files are metaphorically shattered in time like glass and then reorganized into mosaic patterns. The technique used to require laborious preparation outside of real-time before the files could be brought onstage. Now not only can it be done spontaneously while performing, but also with a degree of flexibility that I find quite liberating. They are a lot of fun to play and hopefully to listen. - CS” less"

Mellow pentatonic notes dance over plaintive vocals, intimate and close mic'd, endearing in their simplicity. Drifting from melancholic ballads and pleas for peace, “Akaline Kidal” is a politically charged and poignant recording for a community ripped apart by division and civil war. While the Tuareg guitar genre is popularized by rock heavyweights like Tinariwen and Bombino, the origins of the genre are in simple acoustic arrangements. Created in the 1980s as political folk music, the first recordings were made on contraband cassette tapes. Distributed on underground networks, the music spread throughout the diaspora, planting the seeds of revolution and establishing the Tuareg guitar sound. Recorded onto 8-track cassette tape in a basement studio in Portland, Oregon, “Akaline Kidal” is a call back to those early recordings. Captured in continuous single takes, the effect is unfiltered and raw. Like his predecessors, Ahmed Ag Kaedy imbues his songs with a pointed focus as he transmits a message home.

Ayamga is also drummer in King Ayisoba's band and creates beats and bass for the new Bongo stars. \"Bongo is a small town and is the capital of Bongo District, a district in the Upper East Region of Ghana. It’s a twenty minute drive to the border of Burkina Faso; “we share water” one of King Ayisoba’s band members once said. King Ayisoba, one of Ghana’s most famous musicians, was born and raised in Soe, a small village just outside Bongo; a fifteen minute drive on a sand road. Each time I visit the Bongo District, I have to visit King Ayisoba’s family too and pay my respects. Ayisoba’s father and mother are old but vital, they still work the land. I heard that during the harvest time everyone is a farmer. Young people come back home from the big cities like Accra and Kumasi to help with the harvesting and most of them have herded cows and goats when they were young. Sitting on the back of Francis Ayamga’s motorbike we make many stops. Francis plays the traditiona drum in King Ayisoba’s band and he runs a studio in Bongo. He knows most of the people in Bongo, and there is always something new going on. Of course he has to explain why he has a white man on the back of his bike. The people in Bongo are proud of all the musicians and especially of King Ayisoba and his band who play the whole world and bring the Frafra tradition to all the continents. Actually he is teaching the world some Frafra along the way since King Ayisoba is well known for his powerful shouts and interaction with the audience. During one of the King Ayisoba tours Francis gave me a pendrive full of music he recorded in his studio. I listened through all and heard a lot of great music. I made a selection, sat down with Francis and King Ayisoba and then came the idea to make a compilation that represents the music from the Upper East, focused on Bongo, all in Frafra and full of variation: rap, gospel, kologo and traditional chanting, it’s all there. I spent a week at Francis’ Top Link studio and met many great musicians. One of them was Zenabu, a traditional singer who brought her whole women group. They did not fit in the studio so we recorded them outside and it sounds beautiful.” less"

Palmistry again handles the lion’s share of production in ‘Triad’, matching Vinh Ngan aka Triad God’s drowsy delivery and low key intonation with careful, minimalist dembow/dancehall rhythms and gossamer, elegiac atmospheres, while Organ Tapes also supplies a tenderly rugged backdrop to album closer ‘Chinese New Year’. Rapping and singing a mix of Cantonese and english, Triad God mostly eludes any grip of what he’s chatting for non-Cantonese speakers, but for us, the overall vibe of ‘Triad’ imparts much more than any prosaic reading of the album. From the intimately cinematic mise-en-scene of the intro, thru to the soft-touch choral ambience of ‘So Pay La’ and ‘Gway Lo’, to the Jesus-arms dancehall bumps of ‘BDG’, the angelic cadence of ‘Dill’, and the MIDI meditation of ‘Hay Wan’, it’s the kind of record that quietly demands your attention while never quite looking you in the eye/ear, and does so in the most beguiling style.

'We Played Some Open Chords' is the arresting opener, piano and string reverberations melting together imperceptibly before your very ears; 'Requiem For The Static King' is a beautiful elegy for the late Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, and sure enough it seems to tremble with its own sense of loss. We can't think of many albums that have so skilfully balanced droning minimalism with open, expressive melody; the results are bewitching, swelling to a near-symphonic climax in 'Steep Hills Of Vicodin Tears'.

Salvaged by Daehan Electronics, who were behind LPs of Kim Byoung Duk’s avabnt-garde jazz and Liquid Liquid drummer Dennis Young’s ‘Quest’ in 2018, ‘Circumfluence’ is one of those records that appears out of nowhere to effortlessly bridge loads of stylistic gulfs, only to then recede into the undergrowth until someone with big enough ears comes along and recognises its worth. Keen ears will latch straight onto the rotted bluster of opener ‘Oceanview’, where they spend 23 limning a widescreen worldview as dense and sorely romantic as Leyland Kirby’s ‘Sadly The Future Is No Longer What It Was’ volumes with an array of analog electronics and drums’. Once they’ve sucked you in and swilled you around for a bit, ’See Through Your Eyes’ evacuates into glorious ambient noise and by now you should really know why you made the purchase, as they continue to roll out into misty, slow, lysergic horror film themes with ‘Almost There’, and the heart-gnawing shoegaze bliss/ter of ‘Seeweed’ calves away to leave the coruscating might of ‘Image Eldétique’ feat.

   "name": "'Music for Confluence' is yet another excellent full-length from Peter Broderick, and this time he goes back to the lush, glacial orchestrations of his debut 'Float'. It's probably the cold Berlin winter and the fact that Broderick has an apartment just above a piano store that did it, and these touching vignettes are as beautiful as anything the young virtuoso has released to date. Strings heave and exhale cautiously over delicate field recordings and Broderick's signature pointed pianowork while occasional snippets of vocals erupt hauntingly. It's hardly surprising that the music was composed initially for a harrowing documentary about murders and missing persons in Iowa in the 1980s. Like his previous score work however, 'Music For Confluence' is an album which works just as well without the visuals as it no doubt works with them. It has a narrative all of its own, and enough emotional heft to keep us in awe from beginning to end. A beautiful album, and one that comes with two thumbs up from us. less"

   "name": "This latest set of recordings feasture Broderick's score for a modern dance piece, commissioned by London-based choreographer Adrienne Hart of Neon Productions. The brief demanded a piano and strings-based score, and so Broderick sticks diligently to these instructions, creating a thirty-minute piece divided into seven sections. In keeping with works such as Float, Music For Falling From Trees is an album characterised by a languid, supine beauty that drips effortlessly from Broderick's rich, melancholy arrangements. As modern composition goes this is all unabashedly under the thrall of romanticism, yet by no means is i t a one-dimensional affair: after the drifting loveliness of the first two parts, Broderick engages with a brisk, staccato section for 'Part 3: Pill Induced Slumber', giving a first real indication of how the composer's agenda has been shaped by the quintessentially kinetic realm of choreography. The piece develops into a wild and noisy affair, revealing a real sense of energy and a brief glimpse of an anarchic streak as the music slips momentarily into discordance. Elsewhere Broderick dabbles in otherworldly drone on 'Part 4: The Dream' and goes on to showcase his potential as a more cinematically inclined soundtracker, fashioning a wonderfully expansive and evocative stretch of music for 'Part 6: Electroconvulsive Shock'. It's all at the highest standard, yet tantalisingly, you always feel that there's much more to come from this artist as he continues to mature. Music For Falling From Trees is a very fine thing indeed, though as ever with multimedia projects like this, you inevitably crave access to the visual component. Nevertheless, Broderick's music paints its own vivid and very opulent picture. less"

   "name": "Finding the Stars of the Lid mainstay focussing on a sequence of shorter form compositions evoking the elemental landscape of Bolivia's salt flats and the encroaching doom of industrialisation. ”Having channelled some of the most iconic drift music of our time through A Winged Victory For The Sullen and Stars of the Lid, 2016 has already seen Adam Bryanbaum Wiltzie provide original scores for a number of feature films including The Yellow Birds by Alexandre Moors. It's on the non-fiction film ”Salero” however, that we see Wiltzie weave some of his finest work and deliver an expertly distilled accompaniment to director Mike Plunkett's sprawling, uncompromising visuals. Set in Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, the narrative follows those who have for generations gathered salt and earned enough to somehow carve out an existence in such a barren landscape. It's with the discovery of huge Lithium reserves of a mineral used frequently throughout the tech industry under the scorched earth that acts as a catalyst for exploitation of the environment and its people; holding a microscope to the drastic effect industrialisation has on local culture and tradition. Recording took place in Adam's Belgium-based studio for the guitars, percussion and small string ensemble tracking. Hungary was chosen for the final large string orchestra recordings at Magyar Radio Studio #22 with the Budapest Art Orchestra. ”I have always said that composing music is infinitely easier when you have beautiful images to be inspired by. It was a pleasure to write a score over this captivating place of endless, glimmering salt before its impending demise. I was fascinated by this mythical space and its ability to define the identities of the people who live in its vicinity, where this vast salt flat itself would be a central character” Adam Bryanbaum Wiltzie less"

   "name": "American-born multi-instrumentalist, singer and composer Peter Broderick returns with the score for the award-winning animation of the same name, inspired by an early recording of his, plus a 9-minute electronic rework on the B-side titled Techno For Lemurs. \"Fairly often we see albums of “Music inspired by the film __”, but less common is a film inspired by music. Such is the case with Two Balloons. Director Mark C. Smith got the idea for his nine-minute stop frame animation film while out at sea, looking at a majestic funnel cloud in the distance. Shortly after he heard a song by Peter Broderick from one of his earliest recordings — 4 Track Songs — and the music struck a chord so strongly, he knew he wanted to make a film to fit the melody. And so began the five-year labour of love that would eventually produce this enchanting little film, currently circulating film festivals around the world and racking up countless awards and accolades including ‘Best Original Music Score’ at the New Renaissance Film Festival in Amsterdam. Even though the film was inspired by an older Broderick composition, the score for Two Balloons was recorded from scratch, revised and expanded to fit each frame. The process of stop frame animation is a labour intensive and painstaking one, but the attention to detail didn’t stop at the picture for this film. The score was an integral part of the film from the very beginning, with both the director and composer going to great lengths to experiment not only with the composition itself, but also the fidelity. The first sound heard on the score is a piano playing a waltz figure, and the sound is noticeably lo-fi, but this isn’t just some modern digital trickery. This piano was recorded on a wire recorder, a recording technology that predates magnetic tape and has been virtually forgotten about. In the process of recording the score, many different technologies were experimented with. In addition to purchasing and refurbishing several wire recorders, the director at one stage acquired several massive AM radio consoles as well as an AM radio transmitter, so that a digital recording from the computer could be broadcast through the AM radio waves and then captured through one of these nostalgic sounding old radios. A variety of these technologies from different eras were used to create a score that both sounds like it’s from several different time periods and from no specific time at all. The B-side, if you will, is more than just a remix that recycles the original recordings. In fact none of the original parts have been re-used. ‘Techno For Lemurs’ is a homage to the two main characters in the story, the ring-tailed lemurs Bernard and Elba. Serving as Broderick’s first foray into the world of techno, this playful piece reinterprets the melodic themes from the original score by adapting them with electronic instrumentation. In Peter’s own words: “Let’s pretend for nine minutes that we’re ring-tailed lemurs and get this party started!” less"

   "name": "Nils Frahm: \"The opportunity to work on JR´s fantastic short film ELLIS came through my good friend Yoann aka Woodkid. We agreed on recording the piano parts in my studio in Berlin and so it happened that JR and Woodkid were guests at Durton studio on a wonderful late summer day in 2015. We managed to record all the crucial elements that day. The music fell in our laps and melted with the images: a wonderful experience. The film has stuck in my head ever since; it moved my heart and changed my soul. A couple of weeks later I had to cancel a trip to Brussels because of a terror warning; all events got cancelled and I stayed home, having an unexpected day off. I felt rather depressed that day, thinking that the Europe I knew was already gone. I sat down at the harmonium, listened to Robert De Niro’s voice and played for the rest of the day. The result is ‘Winter Morning II,’ the B-side of the ELLIS soundtrack release. Robert says it all in 17 minutes. We are not facing a refugee crisis. We are facing a crisis because we do not embrace, we do not sympathise and we cannot give up fear. Art can encourage so I hope this project will help fight the fear in all of us.\" Yoann Lemoine, aka Woodkid: \"Ellis is my second collaboration with JR after the New York City Ballet piece for Les Bosquets. I initially wanted this piece to sound like it was recorded on an old piano that we found in the ruins of Ellis Island, in the restricted area that is not open to the public, where JR pasted the pictures on the walls for the film Ellis. I had worked with Nils before and I wanted him to create a sound for this piano part that I composed that was extremely gentle and organic. I wanted the listener to hear the mechanisms, the breathing of the instrument. I wanted it to be imperfect, to sound like a ruin, a trace, an echo, the way the pastings on the walls seem to be ghosts, almost imperceptible. After a few rehearsals, Nils stripped down my piano parts and we removed almost all orchestration around the piano. He then worked on the extended version that is his interpretation of my piece, with Robert de Niro’s vocals. Because this film and this recording is historically meaningful, it was important for us to create this piece as an echo to the immigration situation in Europe, and decided to release it in support of Sea Watch.\" less"

Hecq) with bonus track. “In celebration of their latest signing, Erased Tapes are set to re-issue Ben Lukas Boysen’s compelling debut album ‘Gravity’, alongside new album ‘Spells’ on 10th June 2016. ‘Gravity’ was the first album Ben recorded under his own name, merging programmed piano pieces with live instruments, combining the controllable technical world and the often unpredictable aspects of live improvisation. From ‘Only In The Dark’ to the two movements of ‘Nocturne’, it’s a serious, solemn listen. And yet, with pieces like ‘To The Hills’ and ‘Eos’, ‘Gravity’ is an exploration of heights, cliffs and vertigoes. With piano lines and choir-like drones, this record suits its title in all its meanings, as the magnetic force takes us deeper towards the core. Marking a new beginning, this debut reveals a touching, and more melodic side to Ben’s body of work, which he previously only hinted at as HECQ. Friend and fellow Erased Tapes artist Nils Frahm mixed and mastered the album. Ben is not a master pianist like his dear friend, but his sound collages are so meticulously designed that after hearing the result an impressed Nils declared: “from now on, if anyone asks – this is a real piano”.” less"

   "name": "Not long after the release of Peter Broderick’s seventh solo album ‘Partners’, the composer closes 2016 with ‘Grunewald’. \"Born in just one night inside the four walls of the discrete yet majestic Grunewald Church, situated on the outskirts of Berlin, this five-track EP is an exploration of the alluring partnership between the acoustic space and Broderick's solo performance on piano and violin. Reflecting the grandeur of the room and the natural interaction between the instruments and their surrounding environment, 'Grunewald' pays homage to a very unusual space that's become a haven for an entire generation of contemporary composers. Words from Peter, October 2016: “In the few years between 2008 and 2011 or so, the Grunewald Church in Berlin was something of a hotspot for a group of us musicians. It started when Nils scouted it as a location in which to record The Bells . . . and then it seemed like we were in there every month or two for a while, either for recordings or for concerts. There was a lady living just down the street from the church, and we’d just knock on her door, give her a couple hundred euros, and then she’d hand over the keys to the church! To be given unsupervised access in a space like that is really quite unheard of most of the time… For anyone who likes reverb, the Grunewald is a dream come true. That in combination with the beautiful old Bösendorfer piano made it the perfect place for both recording and performing. When mixing the recordings that comprise this EP, simply titled Grunewald in homage to that old haven of ours, there were no artificial reverbs or delays used . . . only the natural sound of that epic space. Originally these piano recordings were released as part of a split album on a small Japanese label, and the violin piece was included on a compilation, also Japanese . . . but all these pieces were recorded on the same night, in the same space, and it is with great pleasure that I see them reunited for this release.” less"

Revolving Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman and Malachi Favours on the recording, the Ensemble instinctively move beyond jazz’s concerns with melody, harmony and rhythm to a metaphorical and physical headspace where they could cut loose, focussing on the very texture and grain of their sound in a way that effectively resonates with the European avant-garde, while also working as an extension of jazz, proper. Where the notion of free-jazz may have since become associated variously with macho feats of musicianship, psychotomimetic abstraction, and sometimes anything but jazz as most people know it, in the Ensemble’s hands it’s a coolly playful framework for witty, colourful expression and novel combinations of instrumental ideas that rarely test the listener’s patience, and are more likely to light up yer swede in the most pleasurable way. less"

Recorded in Peter’s studio The Sparkle on the Oregon coast, the pair used this solitude to focus on creating something as raw and honest as possible, particularly in what some might deem unattainable during a time where complexity is sought most. In a world full of noise and the anxieties of every day life, Find The Ways brings us together and reminds us to appreciate and confront the simple and fundamental facts of life, and that we as individuals will eventually find our way. Words from Peter and David, January 2017: “I sensed a truly unique character in David’s own music that is wonderfully heartfelt and sincere. With this recording David and I set out to make something raw which is an honest document of what we are capable of doing together at once, with just two acoustic instruments and our voices. The entire album was recorded live, with no overdubs and no edits. Just two guys playing together in a room. I have always dreamed of doing a project in which I only use my violin and my voice and David just plays upright bass and sings. It truly is a fifty-fifty collaboration.” – Peter Broderick “It is such a pleasure to work with Peter. I feel that we're on the same page in more ways than one, both musically and non-musically. The making of this album was an incredibly fun challenge; writing music to be performed and recorded live with only violin, upright bass, and voices. It still amazes me that we managed to make a whole record with only those three elements. Over the years, I have felt a very strong connection to Peter's music and friendship, and I feel that this collaboration comes from a really good place. I hope this music gives the listeners a feeling of comfort, confusion and understanding.” – David Allred less"

   "name": "\"Lubomyr Melnyk returns with his new album ‘Rivers and Streams’, the embodiment of his signature style Ukrainian pianist Lubomyr Melnyk has often felt that his unique Continuous Music playing is akin to water – flowing and ever connected. As he further developed his technique, and the more the notes flowed, the closer to water he felt. “I found my hands and arms and everything inside them changing from normal muscle and flesh to well... water.” With his latest album, ‘Rivers and Streams’, Lubomyr focuses deeply on this connection to water, to the point where the music itself begins to embody its liquid form. Produced by Robert Raths and Jamie Perera, the album flows seamlessly from the live recordings of ‘The Pool of Memories’, captured in a church, to pieces entirely born in the studio, such as ‘Sunshimmers’ and ‘Ripples in a Water Scene’, which feature Perera on acoustic and electric guitar. Amorphous, ever-changing, Lubomyr as performer becomes subsumed into the natural ebb and flow of the keys as the album drifts between nascent upstream trickles and deeply reflective passages through winding river valleys. The album reaches its climax in ‘The Amazon’, a 20-minute piece dedicated to the world’s largest river. Raths invited Korean flautist Hyelim Kim to guest on the first part, before Lubomyr closes the album with cascades of arpeggio figures, stretching across the breadth of the keyboard with rapid virtuosity. Following on from 2013’s ‘Corollaries’ album and last year’s ‘Evertina’ EP, Lubomyr’s latest offering compounds upon his existing fluid signature style, and breathes an organic vitality, both nuanced and thoughtful. \"In the body of the Continuous Piano Master, the fingers and the hands turn into Water, Air and Stone. These are the three manifestations of the Continuous Technique. And for the Continuous Pianist, the fingers physically transform the music into one of these three elements. The greatest of all miracles in the universe is Water. It is also, I believe, the rarest of all physical things in the universe. Water is the most magical and the most mysterious of all things we know! And so I dedicate this album to the Rivers and Streams of this world – in gratitude for their Beauty!“ – Lubomyr Melnyk\" less"

Musical instruments are a somewhat technological anomaly in that they are rarely updated after their conception, often only receiving minor tweaks over the course of hundreds of years. As such, each instrument provides us with a snapshot of the cutting edge technologies of a particular time and place – in this sense, the instrumentation used by Immix provides us with snapshots of technologies that can be traced back as far as 1500BC. Taking these snapshots as a starting point, each movement in 'Transition' features one or two instruments, and, thematically, explores a significant invention or discovery that took place at around the same time as the invention and development of these instruments. Collaborating with Vessel updates this technological chronology by including the tools of the digital age. Immix is lead by Australian-born composer and sax player Daniel Thorne. The now Liverpool-based artist has a genuine passion for exploring and creating music in a diverse range of forms; composed and improvised, acoustic and electronic, and the various shades in-between. Founded in 2014, the idea behind Immix has been to galvanise the innovative musical voices from across the country. With the addition of Vessel, the moniker of Bristolian electronic composer Sebastian Gainsborough, Immix found a valuable first partner in exploring forward-thinking composition that slips between the cracks of traditional and contemporary styles. A stalwart of the UK experimental electronica community, Vessel's solo work has received critical acclaim for it’s post-industrial, visceral tone, using a sonic palette derived from the creation of home-made instruments, aiding in the creation of his signature nonreplicable sound.\" less"

After listening to their music, he immediately knew: \"it was the sound of my new film\". With an excellent cast of France’s finest actors Romain Duris, Charlotte Le Bon, and the director himself, plus a script filled with tension, sexuality and darkness, they knew there was a lot of musical territory to mine. It was agreed that they wanted to explore more analogue electronique experiments as well as working with a large string ensemble, to create something that felt very modern and still cinematic. “Despite A Winged Victory For The Sullen being associated with film score type music, trying to survive the process of creating the modern film score is not for people with fragile egos. It requires those who arethe most responsive to change. The director and the film presented a new set of challenges, so we decided to stop thinking about cinema as an object, and moved closer to using the film’s images as triggers for experiences. The more we were able to let go, and see the music as something that happens, like a process – not a quality, the more we were able to reach a place that sounded like us. It was as if we were making our first record all over again, except being filtered through another language littered with dead metaphors”, the duo elaborate. The recording sessions began with their long time sound collaborator Francesco Donadello in the form of some modular synth sessions in Berlin. Dustin and Adam began working from the script in their own studios, and after filming commenced they continued to create music that could be used for first edits of the film – each day getting new scenes that triggered ideas that would become the base of the film score. Over the course of the next few months the two slowly crafted the music with weekly discussion from their studio to the editing room. The final sessions to what is now the score of Iris were recorded with a 40-piece string orchestra at Magyar Radio in Budapest.Upon label founder Robert Raths' request the over sixty minutes of material were then edited down to a concise album listen at forty-one minutes with a physical release set for January 13, 2017.

Syruppy, seriously fucked chopped & screwed edits of Sade, Araabmuzik, Tirzah, AFX, Lana, Enigma, Riri , Lil Boosie ++++ Like DJ Screw, Rabit also hails from Houston and has long named Screw’s radical style of slowed down and Codeine-infused rap and pop edits as a major influence on his own productions. On the first volume, ‘Cry Alone Die Alone’ he pulls back for a tarry hour of slurred rap and shoegazing electronic haze in keeping with that OG spirit. Part 2, Bricks in a Drought features Sade, Aaliyah, Riri and Ciara slowed down into the mix along with Araabmuzik and more, nailing a proper, dusky, stoop-side sound in 11 parts underlined by the wooziest, gelatinous subs and smudged with glistening compression artefacts to hold listeners under its slow, heavily warped spell. Part 3, The Dope Show, finds Lil Boosie, AFX, Tirzah, Enigma and Lana Del Rey slopped in-the-mix with a special measure of psychedelia and asphalt-grain ruffness. Where the first two instalments were strictly rap focused, this one’s a bit looser with the style, marrying some of the most notable, contemporary female voices with super rugged and bittersweet backdrops. His compound of Lil Boosie and AFX makes us do that thing chefs do when they like da sauce, and he evens manages to make Lana Del Rey palatable in two crashing dollops, while the screwed downstroke of Tirzah’s ‘Gladly’ demands to be heard by anyone who fell for ‘Devotion’ (all a y’all, innit?!), and really, that Enigma track was aways begging to get screwed.

   "name": "Following on from his works Stories and Apologues, Berlin-based composer and vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita returns with his new album Book of Life, the third instalment in a trilogy of solo vibraphone recordings. \"With Book of Life Masayoshi continues his mission in bringing the vibraphone — a relatively new invention in the history of instruments often kept in the background in orchestras and jazz outfits — into the spotlight. Having trained as a drummer, Masayoshi began experimenting with the vibraphone, preparing its bars with kitchen foil or beads, playing it with the cello bow such as in Fog or using the other end of the mallets to create a more ambient texture of sound, as with the title track. Focussing on the vibraphone in this way sets Masayoshi apart, dedicating his artistic life to celebrating this fascinating and often underappreciated instrument and making his take on ambient and modern compositional styles a unique one. “I think the vibraphone is capable of more interesting and beautiful sounds that haven’t been heard before. It’s quite a new instrument but it’s often played in a similar way. I feel that there is a lot more to explore with this exciting instrument.” Book of Life sees Masayoshi expand on his compositional skills, bringing in more orchestral elements such as strings, brass and even a choir to interact with the vibraphone. And not just any choir — members of this chorus include musical friends Peter Broderick, Hatis Noit, David Allred and Shards who featured on Nils Frahm’s latest album All Melody. The instruments come to represent characters in Masayoshi’s stories, hinted at in each accompanying text contained in the album booklet, which Masayoshi recites at his live performances. They set the scene for each piece, for example “the choir in Misty Avalanche is meant to resemble the blizzard, while the vibraphone is the bird hovering above,” he explains. The title track however, was unusual from the start; “Book Of Life is very different to my other songs. It was about humans, whereas the other songs are all about animals and nature. And it was improvised initially, whereas normally my songs are composed and planned. This one was free. I scratched the vibraphone bar as if I was writing something. An image connected in my mind: these two people meeting and sharing their lives. This image was the book of life.” The upbeat lead single It’s Magical features two cellos and a flute as extensions of the vibraphone; “like a man who’s put artificial wings on his arms to attempt to fly like a bird, before an airplane was invented,” says Masayoshi. A different version of the song, called Spaceship Magical, also appears on the Erased Tapes 10th anniversary box set 1+1=X. “Like most of my songs, It’s Magical started from one simple phrase that I’d played again and again. But at one point I had two very different versions; one acoustic with orchestral arrangement, whilst the other had distorted guitars with electronic bass that perfectly suited the collaborative nature of the label residency when Robert invited me to participate.” less"

   "name": "On his 7th studio LP, Nils Frahm shows off the results of recording in his new, bespoke studio, based in the legendary Funkhaus on the bank of the Spree in East Berlin. Frahm’s signature, melancholic solo piano works share space with runs into 4th World soundscaping, illusive rhythms played on organs-as-drum machines, and gingerly crafted posh tech house minimalism. “Since the day Nils first encountered the impressive studio of a family friend, he had envisioned to create one of his own at such a large scale. Fast forward to the present day and Nils is now the proud host of Saal 3, part of the historical 1950s East German Funkhaus building beside the River Spree. It is here where he has spent most of his time deconstructing and reconstructing the entire space from the cabling and electricity to the woodwork, before moving on to the finer elements; building a pipe organ and creating a mixing desk all from scratch with the help of his friends. This is somewhere music can be nurtured and not neglected, and where he can somewhat fulfil his pursuit of presenting music to the world as close to his imagination as possible. His previous albums have often been accompanied with a story, such as Felt (2011) where he placed felt upon the hammers of the piano out of courtesy to his neighbours when recording late at night in his old bedroom studio, and the following album Screws (2012) when injuring his thumb forced him to play with only nine fingers. His new album is born out of the freedom that his new environment provided, allowing Nils to explore without any restrictions and to keep it All about the Melody. Despite being confined within the majestic four walls of the Funkhaus, buried deep in its reverb chambers, or in an old dry well in Mallorca, All Melody is, in fact, proof that music is limitless, timeless, and reflects that of Nils’ own capabilities. From a boy’s dream to resetting the parameters of music itself. Words from Nils, October 2017: “In the process of completion, any album not only reveals what it has become but, maybe more importantly, what it hasn’t become. All Melody was imagined to be so many things over time and it has been a whole lot, but never exactly what I planned it to be. I wanted to hear beautiful drums, drums I’ve never seen or heard before, accompanied by human voices, girls, and boys. They would sing a song from this very world and it would sound like it was from a different space. I heard a synthesiser which sounds like a harmonium playing the All Melody, melting together with a line of a harmonium sounding like a synthesiser. My pipe organ would turn into a drum machine, while my drum machine would sound like an orchestra of breathy flutes. I would turn my piano into my very voice, and any voice into a ringing string. The music I hear inside me will never end up on a record, as it seems I can only play it for myself. This record includes what I think sticks out and describes my recent musical discoveries in the best possible way I could imagine.” less"

So far, his wanderings have led him from solo works into the realms of film, dance and documentary scores, as well as art installations. Now Peter takes that unpredictability one step further. For his latest album, a series of voice and piano recordings, he experiments with chance, surrendering an entire song’s composition to the roll of dice. As he explains below in an email to Erased Tapes founder Robert Raths, it was John Cage’s tendency to remove himself from his music, to somehow automate his own process, which inspired the strange mechanics with which this record was created. In the words of Cage himself, ‘the world is teeming; anything can happen.\" less"

From his father’s cabin based in the German countryside with access to nothing but cymbals, to being surrounded by guitars in Joshua Tree, his unexpected journey soon progressed into what became his first solo album. Daniel played nearly all instruments himself with the only exception being fellow musicians Florian Juncker on trombone, Manu Delago on hang drum and Andreas Voss on cello. Using his Berlin studio as his main base for recording, Brandt created an album that encapsulates the idea that despite setting out with a particular creative vision, external influences and environments will always shift the process, and create an Eternal Something.\" less"

Johnny's Disk Record is an independent jazz label run by the owner of jazz cafe Kaiunbashi No Johnny located in Rikuzentakata City in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The legendary label released a string of albums of high quality but down-to-earth music, spanning from modern jazz, avant-garde jazz, to left-field pop. Albums such as 1980's Farewell My Johnny / Left Alone and 1978's Aya's Samba (STUDIOMUL 013LP) have reached cult status among fans as some of the best works to come out of the Japanese jazz scene. Gogo Sanji No Aki is an album by vocalist Mayumi Sonoda -- a jazz vocalist who looked up to Chris Connor and made her debut at a US Army camp at the age of 16 -- that was recorded with the help of Kichiro Sugino's Trio. Opening with the bilingual ballad \"It's over\", in which she sings in both English and Japanese, the album sees her covering standards that giants like Helen Merrill, Frank Sinatra, and Billie Holiday have popularized, while showcasing her vocal abilities that set her apart from her peers.

   "name": "Erased Tapes’ resident dancefloor hooligan lets it out all out across six cuts of bottom lip-wobbling melancholy and utopian synth themes “London-based electronic songwriter Ryan Lee West aka Rival Consoles presents his most personal work to date in the form of a mini-album titled ‘Night Melody’. The opening statement ‘Pattern of the North’ starts off with a collage of spliced synth melodies, inspired by anxiety that accompanies going home for Christmas. It’s followed by ‘Johannesburg’, an early sketch gradually filled out during his tour in South Africa. “After playing it around some of the cities, I got a lot of inspiration to bring it to life and push it into something that really moves me. I think this is one of my most colourful pieces of music, with its driving rhythm and almost a homage to Terry Riley’s ‘In C’ towards the end, with a build of very simple, hypnotic parts. I especially love that for over five minutes the piece is tied to just one note. This makes the ending very dramatic, because all of a sudden there is this harmonic change.” ‘Lone’ started life around the time Ryan was working on his ‘Sonne’ EP in 2014. It’s the result of constant adjustments to find the perfect balance of fragility and assurance. As everything on the album, it’s a carefully considered, emotionally mature piece. “I think, as I get older, I need music to represent something and not just sound interesting, though of course the two are connected.” The closing statement ‘What Sorrow’ is a fitting end to the album, building from gentle melancholia to a joyous crescendo. It’s a sensibility that’s central to the record; joy and sorrow both find their counterpoints. “This record is very personal to me and I hope it offers something for other people, as it helped me to make it and to listen to it. Almost every synth line was recorded intuitively, without perfection but with a lot of intention and expression. I’m not interested in making something sad or making something happy. I want music to be bittersweet, to be more complex, like life – containing moments of vibrant colour and hope, as much as darkness and sadness.” less"

   "name": "Art edition of John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies’s Halloween soundtrack featuring deluxe packaging with unique art by Chris Bilheimer, as well as a massive foldout poster. \"The new Halloween movie has the distinction of being the first film in the series with creator John Carpenter’s direct involvement since 1982’s Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Carpenter serves on the new David Gordon Green-directed installment as an executive producer, a creative consultant, and, thrillingly, as a soundtrack composer, alongside his collaborators from his three recent solo albums, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies. The new soundtrack pays homage to the classic Halloween score that Carpenter composed and recorded in 1978, when he forever changed the course of horror cinema and synthesizer music with his low-budget masterpiece. Several new versions of the iconic main theme serve as the pulse of Green’s film, its familiar 5/4 refrain stabbing through the soundtrack like the Shape’s knife. The rest of the soundtrack is just as enthralling, incorporating everything from atmospheric synth whooshes to eerie piano-driven pieces to skittering electronic percussion. While the new score was made with a few more resources than Carpenter’s famously shoestring original, its musical spirit was preserved. “It was great,” Carpenter said of the experience. “It was transforming. It was not a movie I directed, so I had a lot of freedom in creating the score and getting into the director’s head. I was proud to serve David Gordon Green’s vision.” less"

   "name": "Arch minimalist Neel gets the most of his machines for One Instrument Sessions “In a scenario of overwhelming number of instruments, musicians often do not take the time to deepen and explore the creative possibilities of each gear they possess. One Instrument aims at counter-acting this tendency by challenging and limiting each artist in producing a composition by using only one instrument of their choice. One Instrument presents \"One Instrument Sessions”, a new format on which each artist shows a more personal narrative of the sound experiments they compose. Neel opens the series with a solo record including “Aria”, a 20 minutes long piece made with the E340 Cloud Generator of Synthesis Technology, and “The Morning After”, composed with the Roland SH-01A. The E340 Cloud Generator is an oscillator which Neel says has always been a fan of. It has eight sines and sawtooth VCOs with unique modulation capabilities. “Aria” came to life while he was preparing for a live techno set: when he stopped the recording the oscillator kept running producing the sound and tones audible in the composition. The Roland SH-101 is Neel’s favorite synth. “The Morning After” is one of the 9 experiments he created while using the boutique version of the machine.” less"

Not Waving. Spread across two longform pieces, O'Rourke channels Popol Vuh on the spiralling, synth-heavy 15 minute A-side, while the flip sounds like highest grade rhythmic Autechre abstractions imaginable. It's by some distance the most crucial, meaningful release on Diagonal in a long while. What started out as a remix project quickly turned into a collaboration-at-a-distance, with Natalizia sending extra parts, pushing O’Rourke to stray as far from the original material as possible. O’Rourke being O’Rourke, the results are nothing short of revelatory. ‘Side A’ renders a chromatic synth knot into a spiralling, heavenly superstructure worthy of comparison to Popol Vuh, slowly emerging from barely-there pulsing embers to a full-on psychedelic shimmer that in turn recalls Keith Fullerton Whitman, Klaus Schulze and Craig Leon, ever-evolving, restless, meditative, agitated. ’Side B' envelopes listeners in a hyper-baroque rave hall of mirrors - all iridescent arps and irregular, automated pulses that refract palatial imaginary spaces. It’s what we imagine O’Rourke and Autechre collaborating might sound like. And if that doesn't get you in a tizz, this one’s probably not for you. Brilliant. less"

   "name": "A personal favourite of Oren Ambarchi and Jim O’Rourke resurfaces on vinyl for the first time, presenting the beguiling but little known avant-jazz experiments of Swiss composer and theatre director Rudi Häusermann... “Black Truffle present the first-ever reissue of Ruedi Häusermann's Galerie Randolph, a masterpiece of solo multi-tracking originally released on CD by Unit Records in 1995. Born in 1948 and residing in the medieval Swiss town of Lenzburg, and virtually unknown outside of the German-speaking world, Häusermann is a multi-instrumentalist and enormously prolific composer who works primarily in the medium of absurdist music-theater. A virtuoso wind player and free improviser who also composes for traditional classical instrumentation, his work is characterized by subtly surreal humor and the unlikely combination of extended technique and simple, at times almost child-like, melodic ideas. Named after his rehearsal room in Lenzburg, Galerie Randolph uses an enormous array of instruments to craft a work of singular compositional vision. Each of the twelve pieces begins from the same two elements: a woozy, sliding scatter of tones played on a home-made contraption stretching two guitar strings between the top of Häusermann's alto saxophone and an amplified cup, and a series of uneasy block chords sounded on accordion and reeds. On each piece these two elements (whose pitch gradually raises throughout the record) are complemented by entirely different material, all of it played by Häusermann. Ranging from layered flutes to one-finger piano melodies to unintelligible vocals to musique concrete interjections to free jazz saxophone explosions, these additional layers combine with the endlessly returning idée fixe of the foundational elements to create a truly dream-like listening experience, a gently deranged realm in which you lose all sense of linear time. Calling up the most unlikely combinations of possible predecessors -- Erik Satie, Gerry Mulligan, and Helmut Lachenmann perhaps -- Galerie Randolph ultimately defies comparison. Almost unknown except to a select group of cognoscenti such as Jim O'Rourke, yet destined to become a cult classic, Galerie Randolph is an instance of that most rare thing: music the likes of which you have never heard before. Mastered by Rashad Becker at Dubplates & Mastering, Berlin.” less"

His debut album, 'Atmospherics' is often heralded as a classic by the diggers who stumble across it, and James' 'Unreleased Works' are a hidden gem of early 90's electronica (if you're lucky enough to own a copy on CDR of course).

   "name": "‘Seven Horses For Seven Kings’ is the staggering new Black To Comm album by Marc Richter, who applies a whole new rhythmic force to his avant-garde sound designs with results landing in a wildly imaginative space between Rashad Becker, Cam Deas, and Nurse With Wound... The project’s first new album since ‘Black To Comm’ for Type in 2014 marks a radical new phase for the german artist. Drawing on recent years’ work, ranging from writing for theatre and film to composing for art installations, apps and sleep music, Richter has realised a phantasmagoria of limitless sound in ‘Seven Horses For Seven Kings’ that plays to the full extent of his powers, and then some, then a bit more. It fulminates dense, emotive energy and intense sensation at every angle, piling in battalions of swarming horns, sky-clawing metal axe riffs and batteries of arcane techno-primitivist percussion in a way that will leave followers of his earlier work astonished at the switch-up, while newcomers will no doubt be shocked into exploring his other work after coming thru and down form this immense album. “Seven Horses For Seven Kings was completed during a particularly prolific period for Richter. Working on a broad range of commissions since his last album - from writing for film and theatre works to composing for art installations, apps and sleep music - generated a flurry of new ideas and influences. Site-specific residencies in particular let Richter shift his focus from melody and song architecture to more abstract sound art. Extensive touring would equally come to inform a key shift in Richter’s music, simulating the raw, unpredictable energy of live performances on record. Rather than ironing out mistakes in samples or his own playing, he exploits or even forces such imperfections. While rhythm has been largely absent from previous Black To Comm releases, here the music seems totally bound to it, from the fractured techno breaks of ”Fly on You”, to the pounding war drums of “Rameses II” and pulsing Mellotron sounds of “Angel Investor”. The album’s breath-taking pace drives Richter’s music to new levels of intensity. Richter’s creative practice is informed as much by careful, attentive listening as it is studio experimentation. Pieces often begin life as a single sound that catches his ear, be it a record from his extensive collection, or something in the natural environment. Samples and instrumentation are sometimes presented authentically, a deliberate reference to an era, place or player, and at other times are twisted beyond recognition. Samples from contemporary artists like Nils Frahm are bent and compounded with fragments of early recorded music and medieval song. Richter blurs the lines between organic instrumentation and digital production to the extent that the two become inseparable. Being able to separate sound from context gives Richter complete command of the emotional impact of his music, imbuing pieces with meaning or stripping it back as he sees fit. While Richter questions whether instrumental music needs to have deeper meaning beyond its sonic qualities, he accepts that the wider world inevitably bleeds into his art. Reflecting the violence and unreality of modern life, Seven Horses For Seven Kings is unashamedly dark, undeniably angry. But rather than be consumed by such emotions, Richter employs them as ecstatic release. Through his mastery of sound, he achieves transcendence through noise, beauty through intensity.” less"

   "name": "Dazed and meandering kosmiche dub workouts from the 12th Isle “Following on from the deranged machine mulch of the Cru Servers we proudly announce the second record on the label to emerge from our native south side of Glasgow. Lo Kindre is the solo project of Irish/Luxembourgish bedroom producer, amateur footballer and award-winning bartender Daniel Magee. Crawling out from the undergrowth at the speed of a snail with dreadlocks this six track EP builds upon his previous venture for Optimo Music and manages to enchant in many of the same ways. Chlorophytum ticks all of the right boxes, sitting somewhere between a budding sci-fi homage, drum machine escapism and a fascination with the motorik styles of West Germany and the wider On-U continuum. Lo Kindre's sound has recently developed by way of countless hours spent twiddling with delay units alongside vintage Italian football commentary and murky casks of Tennents. It culminates here in the following six tracks. The seventh 12th Isle now ecstatically morphs from our galaxy into yours.” less"

The recordings were edited and composed in hotels rooms across the world as Scott was constantly on tour as the drummer for Slowdive, who successfully reformed in 2014. Hodos, the album opener, begins with 85 mph Storm Barney recordings, ending with the fading sounds of bellbirds and cicadas recorded in Brisbane 2018. “I took a home recording I made of Storm Barney in Cambridge, listening to it on repeat when I was flying from continent to continent. I wanted this to be the starting point of the process of musically documenting how much travelling I was doing”. This album was created from the US to Asia, South America to Europe and the Arctic Circle back to the UK via California. “Working in hotel rooms and on flights, listening to and editing the recordings I’d made from all of these distant cities formed the basis of the album. It’s the soundtrack to four years of my life in flux with constant change, jet lag, excitement and the seeming perpetual motion of travelling”.” less"

Like many others, it’s fair to say our knowledge of this region’s musical history is patchy, at best. But we can all trust Discrepant’s Gonçalo F. Cardoso to guide us in this often fascinating and arguably overlooked arena, with emphasis placed on deconstructing its putative clichés in order to re-assemble and re-think preconceptions of Portuguese music. Taking his cues from Michel Giacometti, a french ethnomusicologist from Corsica who made important field recordings in Portugal, Gonçalo unfurls an enchanted and enchanting sequence zig-zagging from Síria’s creaking, droning folk music in ‘Por Riba’, thru the trampling drums and possessed chants of Random Gods, before checking the asymmetric jazz clank of Bruno Silva’s Ondness, which has previously released on Where To Now? and here kinda recalls the unique rhythms of Mark Fell performed by Drumming Grupo De Percussão. Live Low, a group directly inspired by Michel Giacometti’s studies of the portuguese folk repertoire, then play directly into the remit of ‘Antologia’ in the eerily plangent, elegiac beauty of ‘Montemor’, while the like of Banha De Cobra head in more abstract, elemental-instrumental directions, and Fantasma’s vocal dervish vignette gives way to the sticks n’ stone sampler chops of Gonzo, and also what sounds like a wax cylinder recording of pastoral scenes in ‘Pastagens Sonoras II’ by Luis Antero.

Basically; stuff to properly get your ear-teeth into! “On 'Sueda', De Mey explores the fundamentals of FM and Modal synthesis, and combines them in a confined and sparse space. Although the majority of the material is generated digitally, 'Sueda' sounds, at times, surprisingly acoustic. Because of this, the album bears more resemblance to De Mey’s 'Lichtung' for LINE than his more recent work released through other labels. 'Sueda' sounds as if it were composed and played on one singular instrument, and every track on the album figuratively represents a new alloy of resonating pulses in a tight feedback network.” less"

Their brand new album, ‘p.e.a.c.e.’ is a limited edition vinyl release via Janine’s own label, London Field Recordings. \"A pivotal point in Bristol’s dub-informed lineage, Pitchfork compared Maximum Joys sound to “one of the Slits backed by the Gang of Four”, while PopMatters said, “Musically, the group’s use of complex percussion, horns, danceable bass lines, and overtly English female vocals built a bridge between the worlds of Afrobeat, reggae, avant-garde jazz, funk and pop”. Returning with a new line-up and all new material, MXMJoY have crafted an album that remains faithful to their roots but showcases an expanded experimental direction into dark electronics and expertly used samples and effects. An immediately enchanting album, ‘p.e.a.c.e’ also explores lush synthscapes, deep house hooks and a pop sensibility partnered with that unmistakable and bewitching vocal. Across ten masterfully produced tracks you’ll hear an epic amalgamation of their wide scope of influences, and as ever tied up into the unique MXMJoY package. The title track and entrancing ‘Daughters of Tomorrow’ open the album with fittingly trip-hop beats and gloriously catchy choruses while songs like ‘Can Man Conquer It All’ and ‘Ultraviolet’ dwell in darker spaces melodically, with dreamlike washes of keys and delicate guitars. Elsewhere album highlights ‘Archetype’ and ‘We Breathe’ boast some of the strongest songwriting of MXMJoYs career with unforgettable vocal performances and lush electric guitar tones. Rainforth continues; “As a collective band Maximum Joy and as individuals and now as MXMJoY – we have always shared the drive to evolve and keep looking for and finding new sounds & grooves that inspire, challenge, and maybe even soothe! The musical landscape today is exciting – there’s so much out there – I love all the sounds & textures & voices coming through, and Charlie shares that embracing of the new. The things that informed us then – free jazz; hip-hop; synth pop; disco; soul; funk; reggae; punk; world music – have not changed – but inevitably things have been, and always are being, added to those influences.” less"

Somebody’s gotta do it. Who else? Technical knowledge and craftsmanship have improved their creative process, but in the studio they are driven by the same old things. It’s the quest for the beat they haven’t made yet, the eternal hunt for the perfect mix. No bass drum sounds like the other on this record, no snare repeats itself in a different track. Each hi-hat is tailor-made, no synth sound recycled on another occasion. This isn’t one of those predictable techno records, and that’s what makes it such an effort: the endless search for new sounds while always bearing in mind that less is more. “Who Else” represents the sound of Berlin in all its ambivalence.

Stevie can't make a decent living on his music, he's trying to accomplish the task in the Afterlife. This album is an upgrade from the lo-fi, damaged-equipment home recording process for which RSM has become legendary. With a career-long sweep, R. Stevie took some of his best home-recorded lo-fi songs and re-recorded them with full-studio sparkle. All recordings were made in the past 15 years, with tracks captured in five U.S. states. Some compositions date from the 1970s to the 1990s, and there's a few newer tunes. The album lacks one thing: filler. Lou Reed famously said about his final Velvet Underground album: \"I gave them an album loaded with hits,\" then he walked away. Afterlife is R. Stevie's Loaded—an album full of hits. He's walking away with a cane, a bum knee, and cataracts. Afterlife was compiled and produced by Irwin Chusid (who oversees the musical estates of Sun Ra, Raymond Scott, and others). Chusid, a WFMU DJ since 1975, has been a compatriot of RSM since they met in 1978 after R. Stevie relocated to New Jersey from his native Nashville (to which he returned in 2010).

It’s hallucinogenic stuff with a strong synaesthetic appeal, short-circuiting perceptions of sound as language, as visual content, with visceral, unsettling, and challenging results “I like to imagine a time and place where arithmetic is done in a natural way by simply experiencing the unique possibility offered by sound, that of distinguishing simultaneous differences; the non-displacing waves of either AND both. Despite the observations of cool cats like Bill Sethares on the subjective nature of the octave´s perception, one fact remains unfailingly true. An octave is a doubling of frequency - the higher octave has exactly twice the number of vibrations per second than the lower. I am imagining a planet without the invention of writing, even of symbols and scratchings in the sand where, on hearing the sound of a child and an adult singing together, a listener is doing a multiplication by two in a mathematics without signs; arithmetic in the dark. The album consists of a set of 10 works which focus on repetition and change. The pieces evolve mostly through the active perception of the listener. Saccades and oto-acoustic emissions are evidence that perception is far from passive reception. The transmitting ear determines much about what it takes in.

Originally commissioned as a work for 50 members of a local music school in Belgium, 2016, early performances of ‘Sileen’ were chaotic and challenging to the extent that one of the horn players fainted during rehearsals. Zuydervelt later decided to return to the piece in the studio, and came out with ’Sileen II’, a much reduced and more intimate version using Gareth’s clarinet and some electronics for colour. This was subsequently slowed by 50%, in the process revealing a wash of gently overlapping tones and their glacial, airborne harmonic relationships. Through the relatively simple gesture of slowing down the music, Zuydervelt in effect opens it out, providing more time and space to be absorbed by its floating tone clusters and beating frequencies, revealing hitherto unheard worlds within worlds in a way that could be taken as metaphor for the everyday - if our lives didn’t demand it, wouldn’t it be great if we could all slow down and take life at half pace, just imagine what you would notice and how much objective perceptions may change.

As a member of the Kairo Is Koming - or KIK - Collective which counts UIQ’s Zuli as a member, as well as her involvement in the VENT venue, Bosaina has been instrumental in creating the contemporary musical identity of her home city.

For his latest album ‘Tropical Gothic’, however, he takes another sharp turn into more abstract terrain with a dark, brooding take on Exotika and Pacific music, sounding something like Jan Jelinek’s much loved Loop-Finding Jazz Records as rendered by Badalamenti and Lynch, before suddenly veering off into a tropical breeze... Making use of his usual lap steel guitar, sampler and FX, Cooper provides a radical inversion of his style, switching from Pacific to Atlantic ocean to scouting out a looming deep south darkness lurking behind his usually balmy lap steel slide guitar blues. The title itself, “Tropical Gothic” references Cooper’s beloved areas of ‘the South’ with a Gothic, dark, remote interplay. On each side Cooper studies different approaches to his method of weaving guitar and field recordings into a constant stream of sound, where he delivers chaos and melody - not necessarily in that order. Side A is composed of shorter pieces. Each of them offers a myriad of images and sensations, between the enigmatic and terror (“The Pit”), joy, happiness and freedom (“Running Naked”) or pure contemplation (“Onibaba”). “Onibaba” runs as a fitting introduction to Side B and its 18 minute magical piece “Lelong & Gods Of Bali”. A mix of ambient exotica, silent film soundtrack and distorted rhythms that dance around Mike’s guitar.

There's optimism in the chimes, there's trepidation in the repetition, there's dreams buried in the rare beats. Anything feels possible. The modern age human marching through it's life is gripped with the future, the current moment counts for nothing. Red-1 sits you down at the beginning and tells the story. Take a breath. In and out. Sit still for a minute. Remember how it all was. Think about the thing you're on, the thing that was here before you, the thing that'll be here for your future yous. The 12 tracks on this tale trawl the underwater depths of Drexciya's Neptune Lair, the thick foggy gloop of Gas' Königsforst and Stevie Wonder's long lost and forgotten classic The Secret Life Of Plants. Take some time and dig in, Acidliner is holding the steering wheel.” less"

   "name": "Scorching, sprawling, lysergic psych and free jazz jams from Jibóia, a new artist from the fertile Portuguese undergrowth, picked up and presented on the ever-searching Discrepant label. Make sure to check the wild combo of sustained sax peal and pounding drums in ‘Diatessaron’, and the full-blown 15 minute Sufi whirligig styles of ’Topos’ if you like imagining yourself as a character in a frenzied Alejandro Jodorowsky scene... “Earlier this decade, when Óscar Silva chose his alias Jibóia, he was already thinking of the variations his music would take on in each record. Jibóia is Portuguese for Boa constrictor and at his fourth record we got used to his instincts and ability to change over his sound and search for different collaborators to reach his intentions. After collaborating with the likes of Makoto Yagyu, Sequin, Xinobi, Ricardo Martins and Jonathan Saldanha in his previous records, in OOOO he goes deep into interconnecting his music with other musicians/past collaborators. Joined by Ricardo Martins (Lobster, Pop Dell’Arte, BRUXAS/COBRAS, among other projects) and Mestre André (aka O Morto, Alacrau and Notwan), Óscar intended to create a record that sounded like Jibóia with the direct collaboration of the musicians that accepted the invitation. And what does it mean to sound like Jibóia? A fluent and rich dialogue between outer-world sounds mixed with a free jazz approach to rock, living in the limbo between what is fiction and reality. Meaning, it’s music that’s doing soul searching without any space or time barriers. It flows as it should and in OOOO it’s no different. Inspired by the philosophy of Pythagoras and his concept Musica Universalis, that speaks about an inter spatial harmony created by the movement of the planets and the sound frequency it creates. It’s a poetic theory that imagines the sound produced by the movement of the planets and what we can listen to when we listen to the universe. The first three tracks are a reference to those frequencies and the last one, Topos, references an idea of accomplishment, of arrival and the sum of the experience. So, yes, OOOO it’s a bit of a trip. A voyage of imagined sounds produced by three musicians in a constant dialogue and with a different focus in each track. Each of the first three tracks (Diapason, Diapente and Diatessaron) are developed with the focused on the instruments of one of the musicians, while the other two expand and enriches the range of the initial movement. First track focusses on Óscar’s instruments, the second one on Ricardo’s and the third on Mestre André’s. On the fourth and last one they explore the flux of ideas each one delivered to OOOO. Topos doesn’t sum up the experience. It’s not intended to be a conclusion or an end to OOOO, it’s an open circuit of ideas that reinforces the free-minded rock that the three musicians explore, creating a new place where their music finds new routines. It just makes you want to go back to the beginning, again and again, reinforcing the feeling that Jibóia’s music belongs to this world without sounding like anything from this world.” less"

   "name": "Wonderfully disorienting syncretic composition from field recording specialist Laurant Jeanneau a.k.a. Kink Gong; collapsing space into time with a suite of hybrid pieces blending unedited acoustic recordings with computer modified parts for his ever-dilated Discrepant label. Melding contact mic recordings of various turkish instrumentation - Saz, Cura and Tanbur (played by Remi Solliez) - with archival location recordings made in South East Asia (the most common site of Kink Gong’s focus), the Berlin-based Frenchman has forged yet another surreal and alien addition to his illustrious catalogue of outernational sound collage. Like Rashad Becker’s Traditional Music for Notional Species, a radio conflating its frequencies, or a big-eared ET with a cracked copy of Ableton, Kink Gong’s geographically decontextualised sound arrangements push the listener’s limits of perception to short-circuit the senses and create new neural pathways which transcend geography and temporality. We know where the recordings were made, and what they’re documenting, yet the sounds and the cryptic logic behind their organisation eludes any descriptive grasp, or in terms that we already know, at least. To be quite honest, it all elicits some of the rarest sensations imaginable; a feeling of being utterly lost in unfamiliar surroundings, as in a dream, or wandering some mazy bazaar in the mind of Muslimgauze. If you like records to light fires in your mind and synthesise new smells, sensations that aren’t understood or forgotten easily, you really need to check this one out. less"

Part of an avian trilogy also including Bamboo For Two [2010] and The Garnet Toucan [2012], this is some of The Skaters member’s most hypnotic gear; five tracks, 39 minutes of curdling harmonies and drum loops which may induce listeners to dance, praise nature, and book a holiday to somewhere warmer “A deep dive into this record makes it clear why it should be re-released. Spencer’s chaotic and mysterious approach to releases, made some really hard to find or listen to due to the nature of them and how they were made available. Despite his career not being very long and that the internet has made it easier to trace most of his back catalogue, in order to understand Spencer's work some archaeology needs to be done. To better understand his own “Fourth World”, or his alien language music, and to expand its vivid musical colours, records like Make Mine, Macaw need to have the special treatment and attention they deserve. Let’s just say that in the field of experimental-tropical-cocktail music, no one does it like Spencer Clark, especially through his output Monopoly Child Star Searchers. Make Mine, Macaw explores the best cocktail recipes through five colourful pieces, using Clark's premium technique of blurry repetition and dreamy percussions. It's “Fourth World” is one fulfilled with many dimensions that needs the attention you give to a Rubik's Cube when you play with it for the first time. After that it gets better and better. A tropical fantasy that starts in your ears, feeds your brain and changes your life. You won’t know what a pacific city sound vision is until you see one.

The original compilation was released exclusively on Kenneth Goldsmith’s brilliant UbuWeb facility back in 2003-04 (go check it if you haven’t already!). The project’s relevance or use to anyone under the age of 35 beyond chill-out music for electro-swing raves is debatable nowadays, but for folk who still buy into that olde English sense of humour and can stomach the detritus of boomer culture, it’s good for a chuckle. Like a Barbara Windsor gif. “\"We strongly believe in the power of profit through free distribution. Often people have never heard of an artist because they aren't being distributed through as many channels as they should be, due to the very poor state of music/media distribution for non-major label music coupled with ignorance of the way that avant garde art forms infiltrate mainstream culture. Also many prints of a work are allowed to go out of circulation or are deleted for no reason other than cost effectiveness by a label/publisher. This makes perfect sense financially, but no sense whatsoever that a year's work by an artist should also disappear for such reasons. So get all of this while you can, and we completely endorse getting one's work out there, no matter what. If you don't share, your profit is limited.\" - People Like Us, 2004” People Like Us is audiovisual collage artist Vicki Bennett, who has been making work available via CD, DVD and vinyl releases, radio broadcasts, performances, gallery exhibits and online streaming for 25 years. Since 1992, she has developed an immediately recognisable aesthetic repurposing pre-existing footage to craft audio and video collages with an equally dark and witty take on popular culture. She sees sampling and appropriation as folk art sourced from the palette of contemporary media and technology, with all of the sharing and cross-referencing incumbent to a populist form. Embedded in her work is the premise that all is interconnected and that claiming ownership of an “original” or isolated concept is both preposterous and redundant.” less"

Recorded in Rome during the summer before the millennium, this was the first release on his Hipshot label and also the first in a series of three Ambient Exotica Soundscapes, rustling in a signature language of field recordings, guitar strokes and tape loops used to create a rich, abstract narrative intent on quietly colour your listening space at low volume. From what we’ve heard of Cooper to date, this is surely one of his most psychedelic, even unnerving, releases; mostly using the guitar as a source of scrapes, plongs and strangeness rather than melodies, and operating in a perpetual state of flux between his elemental location recordings, loops, and FX, all adding up to an overgrown and curious electro-acoustic ecology. less"

   "name": "This hugely influential, definitive collection from electronic music pioneer and founder of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Daphne Oram, has been out of print on vinyl since 2013 and is now thankfully available again via Modern Love sidelabel, Young Americans. Throughout her life, Oram was a wildly original musician, inventor and theorist who refused to bow to convention. While Delia Derbyshire had more or less become a household name, it was only when Clive Graham compiled ‘Oramics' for a CD release in 2007 that Daphne's legacy started to extend beyond the fringes. In the intervening years (aided by the work of the Daphne Oram Trust and Oram’s archive at Goldsmith’s in London) there have been countless articles, features, a play, an exhibition at the science museum and even a creative arts building and several record labels and arts awards named in Daphne’s honour - going some way to restore her place as a recognised pioneer of electronic music. To recap, Oram was the founder of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, a department she more or less single-handedly created in 1958 camping out at the BBC studios for nights on end splicing tapes and working with various modified machines to carefully arrange her abstract soundscapes. Eventually the BBC bent under her pressure and, in studio 13, created the soon-to-be-legendary Radiophonic Workshop - with Oram its first director. Among her countless other achievements, Oram is also cited as the first woman to design and build an electronic musical instrument, one that worked around the 'drawn-sound' technique whereby strips of 35mm film would be manipulated before being fed into her home-made 'Oramics' machine which would convert and 'read' the film into sound. She was also a prolific writer and lecturer on electronic music and studio techniques, developing concepts of spatial sound years before terms like \"spatial sound” were even used. Despite her considerable and historic list of achievements, Oram's life and work remained largely unknown by the wider public for many years until Clive Graham compiled this set. Spanning 44 tracks, it demonstrates Oram's work as some of the most varied and groundbreaking electronic music ever made. As opposed to so much of the Radiophonic-era material that has surfaced over the last few decades, Oram's work is often characterised by a much more layered and introspective quality, offsetting playful interludes and commercial recordings with beautiful, immersive pieces like the breathtaking \"Pulse Persephone\" and \"Bird of Parallax” - highly atmospheric and experimental variants of musique concrète and tape music that still take our breath away 45 years later. It's impossible to over-emphasise the importance and influence of the material compiled on ‘Oramics’, a set that should be considered compulsory listening for anyone with even just a passing interest in electronic music. less"

   "name": "Sugai Ken keeps us rapt to his genuinely idiosyncratic sound with Tele-N-Tech-Da; a playfully psychedelic computer music suite inspired by ancient Japanese culture and customs. Like his trifecta of aces released by EM Records, Lullabies For Insomniacs and Rvng Intl since 2016, this album is perceptibly trippy no matter which way you approach it. Tele-N-Tech-Da appears to be Ken’s attempt at broadening and inhabiting the schism between history/tradition and a form of pure artistic expression unhindered by the weight of historicity. To give some grasp of the results, the artist likes to think of them as “…like an imaginary radio play”, and we’d expand that to an imaginary radio play from another dimension, heard on a cranky DAB with a life of its own, thanks to the album’s brilliantly freeform, abstract logic. Finding a perfect home on Discrepant, lodged amid Pierre Bastien and Kink Gong records, Ken really takes the opportunity to cut loose, at times sounding like esoteric Coil experiments, and at others like a Sublime Frequencies transmission from parallel planes, ultimately leaving us baffled but ready to try and navigate a way back thru it all. less"

There are some 30 tracks by our reckoning, ranging from vocal chants to tinny electronic instrumentals, and including a randomly scattered handful of locked grooves for those who really want to get into it.

Doing what Leyland Kirby, William Basinski, Philip Jeck or Stephan Mathieu did to old shellac 78s, vinyl ephemera and tape, Koray Kantarcıoğlu turns ’60s and ‘70s Turkish records into spellbinding webs of crackle and ghostly harmonic structure, offering acres for the nocturnal imagination to roam. If you like any of the aforementioned you need to spend some time with this dark, surprising, and transcendent side. “With the vinyl release of “Loopworks” we continue to manifest the importance of showing how technology and geography create different and original approaches to the standard western interpretation of field recordings and sound manipulation. Koray Kantarcıoğlu’s work here is a strong manifestation of that and how “haunted music” can express a myriad of feelings and sensations. “Loopworks” has a tremendous vision of the metamorphosis that’s been occurring in ambient music during the last decade. Sometimes it’s dreamy and calm as aquarium music is (“500606” or “22 47 91 Take 1”); surprising and infinite as “263 Loop”, one of the few tracks with a voice, in this case a mysterious and transcendental one; or part of a John Carpenter & David Lynch film yet to be made (“Organ Extract KP 001”).

   "name": "Lady of Mine is the 1989 debut LP by self-made Italian-American Joe Tossini. An astoundingly honest, passionate record of cosmopolitan lounge music, he willed this charming suburban oddity into existence without any formal musical training. \"Sicilian by birth, Tossini drifted around the world between Italy, Germany and Canada, before finally settling in New Jersey. After the passing of his mother and the breakdown of a second marriage, an anxious and depressed Tossini took to songwriting as a form of therapy, crafting disarmingly candid lyrics from his extraordinary life and loves. Whatever industry savvy or musical virtuosity he lacked was made up for by unflinching resourcefulness and infectious charisma. Befriending bandleader Peppino Lattanzi at local club The Rickshaw Inn, he was encouraged to animate his singular songs with an ambitious cast of 9 players and 5 backing vocalists, sincerely credited as his Friends. The Atlantic City basement sessions are a low budget, high romance testament to Tossinis character and the power of positive thinking. From the defiant, Casiotone samba of If I Should Fall In Love, to Wild Dreams dizzying escapism and the native tongue croons of Sulla Luna and Sincerita, Lady Of Mine hums with the inimitable magic of a true original. Piercing the heart with an effectively sparse combination of humming keys, CompuRhythm drums, horn flourishes and backing divas, ample room was left for Tossini to frankly deliver his much-needed life lessons. Underperforming commercially at the hands of short lived label IEA Records, Lady Of Mine has since earned a place in the outsider music canon. Recently peaking interest as a cornerstone of the Sky Girl compilation, the private press trades for inordinate sums, typically with no financial benefit to its creator. Lady Of Mine is now finally reissued on the artists own terms via Joe Tossini Music, in partnership with Efficient Space, restored from original master tapes with unseen photos, extensive liner notes and Tossinis trademark wisdom.

Cardoso, and Ruben Pater, author of The Drone Survival Guide. Between an 18-track LP and a 12-page book of diagrams, map, notes and poetry, replete with bibliography, we’re presented an in-depth survey of the encroaching influence and affect of unmanned drone aircraft and their military, commercial and civilian applications. The vinyl contains an unprecedented archive of 17 evocative recordings from a range of drones on the A-side - from the swarming buzz of a light and nimble QAV400 quadcopter (four motors) right up to face-melting jet propulsion of a Northrop Grumman X-47B - all introduced by the voice of Emmet O’Donnell. Meanwhile, on the B-side, the project starts to come into its own with Gonçalo F. Cardoso’s 23 minute concrète composition, The Life and Death of a 21st Century Drone Machine. Here the study shifts from cold hard fact and into a form of speculative sonic fiction not dissimilar to Steve Goodman and Toby Heys’ AUDiNT project. Taking cues from Nasser Hussain’s Phenomenology of a Drone Strike, Cardoso posits a electro-acoustic narrative of figurative connections between bird calls and streaking drone sonics, whilst also attempting to find the human in these unmanned craft; whether thru the scrambled comms of their operators thousands of miles away at the other end of a satellite link, or, perhaps more affectingly, with the Tuareg drone song of Mali singer Fadimoutou Wallet Inamoud - used with permission of Sahel Sounds - who hails from a Saharan region often surveyed and attacked by drones.

The Guitar and Other Machines Deluxe was produced by Stephen Street, who’s maybe best known as a longtime producer/co-writer for Morrissey, and also features Reilly’s longtime associates Bruce Mitchell and viola player John Metcalfe. It was written in response to a christmas present of “a load of electronic instruments” from Tony Wilson to Vini Reilly, who remarked at the time “I never dreamt of getting into this electronic thing, and I struggled and fought and stayed up til half seven in the morning and really worked on it. I know that Tony’s got this vision and I persevered.

His electroacoustic and sound art research takes different shapes: compositions for records, radio works, installations or performances. Environmental sound recording is central in his work, which takes from Musique Concrète and the sonic exploration of soundscapes. \"For stridulations, Meursault confronts recorded and performed sounds, composition and improvisation: field- recordings of animal communication (insects, birds and bats recorded in France, Japan and South America over almost ten years) mix and dialog with the ‘sonification’ of fluorescents tubes. Both the environmental sound matter composition and the electromagnetic instrument have evolved with performances between 2014 and 2017. Little by little, new recordings were collected and new electrical and electronic supplies were added to the setup. The record is altogether the outcome of that process and a different take on the project, leaving the synesthetics of the flickering lights but embracing the deepness of ‘blind’ listening. For Pali Meursault, the long research for stridulations has been a practice for deconstructing binary oppositions between nature and machine, bio- and anthropo-phony, and instead to explore the strange sonic affinities that exist between some animal voices and technological phenomena. The performances were a way of switching from a contemplative and ideologic relation to the soundscape to a praxis of noise, using animals and electromagnetic sounds as sonic qualities, possibilities, and intensities.\" less"

The Princess, who was openly gay, specified that female voices should be used for texts that were originally written and supposed to have been spoken by men. Satie presents ’Socrate’ as a symphonic drama in three parts, with his signature sense of refined minimalism serving to place attention on the emotion contained within the text.

Ruins... despair... echoes of madness...and in this maelstrom of decay, I was born.'' It’s feels as though they’re recounting the same travails from alternating perspectives, and with differing palettes, accents, although they share a mutually comprehensible sonic language of weatherbeaten electronics. German Army’s contributions tend to be more rhythmic, scraped together from scratchily hypnotic drums and dynamic dubbing, whereas Old Komm’s parts provide greyscale, tonal counterpoints rich in atmospheric detail. Combined, they speak of atrocities to come, extinguishing any hope at the end of the tunnel. less"

   "name": "A strong look for fans of Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement, Mestre André aka O Morto’s The Forest, The People and The Spirits is a steep trip into densely overgrown and at times surreal electronic emulations and manipulations of natural sounds and pygmy polyphonic music. “An immersive electronic tryptic piece dedicated to the Ba'Aka people and its spirits. Albeit his music is now closer to a soundscape composition approach, O Morto (aka Mestre André) actually started as a free improv / noise project in 2012. However, after releasing his debut “Memento Mori”, O Morto slowly began to drift away from the harshest soundscapes to seek for a new direction. He found it under the form of the polyphonic music played by Ba’Aka (a pygmy tribe that still lives in the Republic of Congo), and in a conceptualised image of Jengi - a forest spirit that feeds from the flesh of a sacrifice. Having this exotic array of influences in mind, O Morto collected samples, field-recordings and electronic sounds that would eventually appear in the dense (and sometimes enigmatic) triptych piece “The forest, the people and the spirits”. Originally composed for 8 digital tracks in the sonic research studio of SFU Burnaby (Canada), the record explores the possibilities of sound manipulation as a way to create rich, vivid and cinematic soundscapes. A noise maker by nature, André also plays in the excellent Älforjs and produces some of the most addictive beats as Notwan. —António M. Silva” less"

C. Schmidt (Matmos) pored over their archives of honky tonk classics, chopping and dicing Nashville's finest almost beyond recognition, and collectively restitching the mangled shreds in a kind of crazed digital quilting bee. Several tense rehearsals and strong pots of tea later, the foursome shuffled on stage and delivered the goods: from panoramic twangfests to offkilter waltzes to barn burning stompers. Flickering and tranquil one moment, and wildly slapstick the next, Wide Open Spaces hits the sweet spot between song forms and improvisation, and showcases the qualities that all three collaborating artists share: absurdist humour, baroque sample manipulation, and stuttering rhythmic frameworks that lurch and sway. While the presence of five samplers, four laptops, three CD players and a pedal steel guitar on one stage could have led to a tediously ego-driven \"jam\" or simply cacophony, the results feel lushly detailed but not cluttered, and swing naturally between structure and freedom. It's an international media magpie summit where country's chick-a-boom meets tech house's boom-tschak, and tearjerking sentiment and patriotic hokum are subjected to a dense shower of coughs, sputters and rude noises. Listening back to the recorded results, all three musical units agreed that this concert was mighty fine, and worth sharing.\" less"

With an uncanny, even unsettling ability to hold her listener’s ear-gaze, Julia’s follow-up to 2017’s ‘Dawning On’ finds the Berlin-based Aussie continue to recontextualise her instrument with elegant precision to yield a sublime tension between her heavy-lidded vocals and iridescent strings. In Julia’s remarkable 14 minute opener ‘Of Neither’, strings fluidly cascade from her fingertips into an amniotic soundsphere of field recordings and gently fleeting synth figures. When combined with the deep dreaming texture of her autotuned vocals and wind-blown harmonica, the effect recalls a sort of midnight Tuareg blues half-remembered from a fevered sleep. It’s deeply beautiful stuff, periodically fading into and out of the light, only to return with more intense inflection and density, yet ever more spaced out, leading to the internal pocket of ‘Lament’ and its achingly coaxed secrets. With recipients suitably defocussed and in pliable state, Julia takes the whole other side to play on that line between organic and processed material, slipping from noirish, filmic intrigue into the middle distance where her rustic coruscations twirl in a set dance with their spectral reflections, rendering a shimmering, introspective and highly individual solo dialogue. less"

He (i.e. Jack) was so spontaneously prolific; he was a poet. I can play some things for you right now and you would be shocked to find out he had no idea what he was about to sing. The lyrics were absolutely phenomenal, and they were extremely spiritual in context in terms of the message he was talking about. They were Biblical lyrics; absolutely overwhelming – just incredible”.

Sounds derived from the war which still and always live in my mind' “This record is a previously unheard masterpiece of Israeli multimedia artist Ami Shavit. As a professor of both philosophy and art and established kinetic artist in the 1970s Shavit was fascinated with new and interactive technologies. While mostly focusing on visual art and mixed-media installations, a trip to New York in 1972 introduced him to synthesizers and triggered his curiosity to do some explorations into the world of music or \"sound\" as he preferred to call it. Ami's research was focused on the concept of meditative music that would help people to relax and create a cosy mood associated to the alpha brain waves and biofeedback. Before starting his artistic career, like all Israeli citizens, he had to serve in the army to his personal regret. Shavit had an operational position, which meant a high probability to get involved in a so called 'hot situation'. When in 1973 the Yom Kippur war broke out, Ami was enlisted again and got the unfortunate opportunity to encounter, in Hanoch Levin's words 'the dead'. Being an operation officer he was in charge of evacuating Israeli wounded officers from battlefields to hospitals. Some 6000 injured men passed through us during that war, he recalled one year later in a newspaper interview.'I witnessed some sights that I can hardly forget. On the one hand I felt that as an artist I had to express the war events, on the other hand I felt that this is an almost impossible mission. Only Goya and Picasso, in his Guernica, addressed this topic successfully.' Yom Kippur is the final and seminal of Shavit's sound experiments ever recorded and now finally available to the world. We believe that this is an extraordinary strong piece in which the hectic moods and terrific experiences of war are deeply transmitted to the listener. May all soldiers, who are often forced to go through traumatic experiences beyond their own will, find ways to artistically digest and process the unwanted memories.” less"

   "name": "Genteel covers of classics by the late, great singer/songwriter Arthur Russell, from Portland lot, Peter Broderick and Friends “It all began in summer 2017 when Peter Broderick's former Efterklang bandmate Rasmus Stolberg invited him to perform at his new festival in Denmark, with the specific idea that Peter would play an entire set of Arthur Russell songs. As a long-time lover of Arthur’s work, Peter immediately accepted the invitation and began to learn a collection of Russell songs. Stolberg put together a band of Danish musicians to join Broderick on stage, and the festival performance went off without a hitch. Immediately after, Peter starting receiving invitations from other festivals, asking for the same thing — a full set of Arthur Russell songs. Even Arthur’s long-time partner Tom Lee took notice of these performances of Arthur’s work, and reached out to Peter personally. It wasn’t long before Broderick was invited to examine some of Russell’s archival work, and asked to do audio restoration work on the old tapes. Peter’s strong love for Arthur’s work grew exponentially as he dove into the psyche of his hero, listening to hours and hours of unreleased material. He discovered that some of his favorite Russell songs have yet to be heard by the masses, and felt inspired to learn some of these tunes himself. It was inevitable that Peter would record an album of his own renditions of Arthur’s songs. And there was no better place to do it than the state of Maine, where most of Arthur’s surviving family are based, and where Broderick himself was born back in 1987. With a large cast of friends and family, including Arthur’s niece Rachel Henry and nephew Beau Lisy, Peter set out to capture his love for Arthur’s music with a diverse collection of 10 songs, two of which have yet to be released in their original versions. Its cover adorned with an original painting by Tom Lee, ‘Peter Broderick & Friends Play Arthur Russell’ is a vibrant and joyful tribute to one of Broderick’s greatest heroes. Peter extends his deepest gratitude to all of Arthur’s family, friends and fans who have so warmly welcomed his own versions of these tunes. It is hoped that these recordings will serve to honor the truly staggering legacy of Arthur Russell.” less"

   "name": "Glassy, new age FM synth chimes, fragrant atmospheres and jazzy, light-footed drum machine programming, hatched in 1989 and reissued for first time - tipped to fans of Lifted or Ramzi “Performing throughout the 1980s as Art Carnage to the gloomy hipsters of Portland, Attilio Panissidi III decided he needed a vacation. The result of his creative escape became Art Takes A Holiday, an album of fabricated FM synthscapes and MIDI environments that embrace elements of smooth jazz, new age, and pop. Attilio had been playing in bands since he was thirteen, and had opened live shows for countless acts, from The Shangri-Las to Bruce Hornsby. The experience of producing, performing, as well as years spent writing for local music magazine The Downtowner, earned Attilio a gig to score a commercial film for a home security systems company. The opportunity allowed him to explore softer elements in his writing, and he created a suite of songs much deeper than the commission warranted. These instrumentals caught the attention of Marlon McClain (Dazz Band, Shock), who invited Attilio to produce and release the music on his fledgling Nu-Vision label. Thus Art Takes A Holiday found its commercial release on cassette and CD in 1989. Although originally intended as soundtrack music, the album retains its own momentum, narrative and evocative imagery that betrays Attilio’s years of crafting songs. Attilio found a perfect ambience on this mythic retreat, somewhere between William Aura’s summer cottage on Half Moon Bay and DJ Alfredo’s Balearic island getaway.” less"

Music to be played at night.\" \"Pianisme is a collection of unreleased and out-of-print piano works composed and recorded since 2004. Most of them are part of soundtracks for feature films by french director Sébastien Betbeder (from 2007's Nuage and the very rare short film Nu devant un fantôme - whose music was completely unpublished until now). Also released for the first time: In the twilight of Paris (written the day after Luc Ferrari's death, as a quiet homage to a composer whose works have often been part of the Sub Rosa catalogue) and Soñando, straight repetition and variations on a minimal pattern, created for choreographer Christian Rizzo's 2010 show L'Oubli, toucher du bois.” less"

   "name": "Arch mutant Joachim Nordwall gets it on with Kevin Drumm and friends on a collaborative album dedicated to Mika Vainio for Antwerp’s Entr’acte. A consummate collaborator, Nordwall patently knows where, when and how to subsume the ego and merge with other, like-minded artists, more often working with others than not. In the 8 parts of ‘Communication is the Key’ he sequences a diaristic account of his meetings with other, fellow underground lynchpins, in the process covering a broad disarray of styles within a brutalist, greyscale framework littered with strange signs of life. Acting as the constant in a variegated sprawl, Nordwall supplies insistently heavy subbass pulses and flinty rhythms that betray his presence in both the tense, palpitating abstraction of ‘Orientation of Senses’ recorded with Coppice in Chicago, and again in two works with Gabi Losoncy recorded on the train and in Philadelphia’s Jefferson Station, each distinguished by Gabi’s favoured field recorded textures, before also underlining the hypnagogic, naturalistic haptic of Tim Barnes & Jeph Jerman’s scuffed haptic in ‘Hashimotor’. The results become much more ambiguous and metamorphic when they shift focus from rhythm to tone on two interconnected, untitled collaborations with Kevin Drumm, the first making use of a creaky, disfigured husk that sounds like a post punk drum track slowed and pitched down 1000%, while on the second Drumm’s glowering drone takes on an almost radioactive glow, exuding lonely, existential dread. To end the album, Nordwall's collaborations with John Duncan provide the album’s uncanniest moments with two works recorded at various Gothenburg studios, where the pairing invoke a genuinely chilling dance of boneless spectres, shrieking winds and metallic resonances. less"

   "name": "Air Max ’97 expands and reshapes his mutant club palette to create an abstract narrative trip in ‘Nacre’, the Berlin-based Aussie producer’s devious début album. Over the 5 years since he self-released the Anodized EP, Oliver Van Der Lugt a.k.a. Air Max ’97 has become synonymous with the push towards smart, demented club music via releases on Liminal Sounds and his own label, Decisions, plus some searing remixes for Kelela and Ziúr. With Nacre he puts that boundary pushing-and-crossing nous to fine use in 10 tracks of giddy, zinging rhythms riddled with mercurial colour. In a sense, their off-centre dislocation and variety strongly suggests the experience of traversing club to airport to different country and back again, reflecting or emulating the feeling of fractured circadian rhythms and tonal clashes that should be familiar to anyone who travels a lot, or even just to us pedestrians, faced everyday with a world seemingly in flux and chasing its own tail into a dizzying headspin. DJs will find useful gear in the likes of his heavily swanged opening bubbler Prfanations, as well as the hyper foxtrot and carving subs of Veneer, and the laser-guided wonk of Karyon, but they’re best taken in context of the album’s border matrix, which acts like a playground for Air Max ’97’s most emotionally skizzy, fractious and off-kilter antics. less"

   "name": "Wonderful early electronic film soundtrack from ‘60s Soviet Czechoslovakia, riddled with pioneering concrète techniques and flush with majestic strings. Another sterling edition to the Finder Keepers catalogue. “Liška, the Czechoslovakian word for fox. Beguiling in its beauty, cunning in it’s charm. Said to be one of the most intelligent animals on the planet its global family consists of thirty-seven varieties; all of them recognised, respected and feared for their persuasive, creative, resourceful and elusive nature. The Liška we will talk about today is no exception to these hereditary rules and within the grooves of this record Finders Keepers present an “elusive” musical artefact that best exemplifies every facet of this composer’s animal namesake. Had he not been born in the small Bohemian town of Smečno in the early 1920s the story of The Fantastic Mr. Liška might have well taken a different course. Alternatively, fettered by the hampers of communism, this lifelong resident of Czechoslovakia would never quite find his seat at the same table as the likes of John Barry, Ennio Morricone, Michael Nyman and Stanley Myers, nor drop enough phonographic breadcrumbs to track his legacy. But having waited patiently behind the borders of the wider landscapes of international cinema, Liška’s musical brood, spanning multiple stylistic decades and generations, has now started to walk proudly amongst his would-be, latter-day compeers. In an era where music lovers have almost become immune to adjectives like “lost”, “rare” and “unreleased” in a climate where previously lesser-known off-kilter master composers such as Vannier, Kirchin and Axelrod have become widely revered, it is perhaps the perfect time for discerning listeners to advance above the feeding trough and seek out this truly pioneering and revolutionary Eastern European composer. Rivalled only by the likes of Krzysztof Komeda and Andrzej Korzynski in Poland, alongside Alexandr Gradsky in Russia, and often splitting workloads with fellow Czech composers like Luboš Fišer, Zdenek Liška’s filmography of over almost 300 fully formed movie scores virtually eclipses the achievements of these socialist era luminaries. Respected unanimously in both Czech and Slovakian by studio bosses, producers, directors and actors alike Liška is widely known for his ability to take the existing energy in a reel of film and literally change the polarity to suit his own interpretation while maintaining the full support from his “client” who would in-turn end up working under this composer’s creative direction. Not only was Liška a genius of emotive orchestral and coral composition, his grasp on small group arrangements and intimate, minimal scores set him above the competition. By utilising primitive sample techniques by “looping” a films existing ambient noise, or rearranging found sounds and dialog into subtle melodic arrangements, Liška would independently develop his own techniques which had simultaneously become known in Paris as musique concrète. It is a direct extension of these experiments that saw Liška also draw parallels with Walter Branchi (Ennio Morricone’s main electronic sidekick) in Italy as well as Daphne Oram in the UK, making Liška a relatively untravelled pioneer of early electronic composition and sound design due to his unlikely global environment. Imprisoned, preserved or reserved; time has been kind to Liška’s music.” less"

   "name": "WTN? pluck another bewt with Myriam Bleau’s fractal, polymetric sound designs, teetering in free space between styles and structures also explored by Mark Fell, Tomoko Sauvage, RKSS, Holly Herndon, Rian Treanor, Visible Cloaks... “Myriam Bleau is a composer, digital artist and performer based in Montreal. She creates audiovisual systems that go beyond the screen, such as sound installations and performance-specific musical interfaces. Her hybrid electronic practice explores music performance as a codified cultural manifestation and recontextualizes pop culture elements and music history tropes. For 'Lumens & Profits' Myriam has exported this ethos towards pure sound design, deconstructing a palette of familiar musical forms into 8 pieces of wandering, weightless movements; where Vocal samples and percussive rushes launch themselves from empty space, repeatedly shattering any vibe you were about to ease yourself into. Rhythms scatter, violently collapse, and pick themselves up again grinning with hands aloft, sprinting towards the light. This is the sound of an artist who clearly has a deep interest in modern tropes of UK bass music and contempory electronic composition, but due to Myriam's historical grounding as a tactile, experimental audio visual artist these genres become uniquely filtered through a performative, Musique Concrete focused lens. In this sense the pieces end up as somewhat hybrids, absorbing Myriam's rich performance based musical history and sweeping into the mix the outer corners of avant garde 80's sampler experiments, Hip-Hop Turntablism, and classical elements. With 'Lumens & Profits' Myriam has managed to create something which sounds distinctly fresh in approach, whilst managing to playfully & respectfully nod towards a tidal wave of cultural movements. 'Lumens & Profits' is heavily influenced by Myriam's own 'Musical Spinning Top' A/V performance 'Soft Revolvers' (viewing a section of the spellbinding performance does the piece far greater justice than I could ever try to clumsily put into words - https://vimeo.com/104996493). Whilst inspiration was gleamed from the performance Myriam is keen to separate the two projects, explaining - 'While composing these pieces, I was very occupied by the idea of modulated speed or tempo that came from my spinning top performance. Seeing instruments on different tempos that fluctuate rather than run on different strict patterns. I tried to imagine freely moving instrumental lines that only momentarily align, rather than a grid or tempo that would control all the elements. A lot of the pieces rely on algorithmic arpeggiation (custom max patches), as a way to create processes that control the speed and timbral width of sounds dynamically.’” less"

Following their early hauntological investigations ‘Eternal Flame’ and ‘In Your Cities, What About Feelings?’ on two tapes with Forever Now, Dave Saved and NPLGNN pair again for a more tortuous and visceral simulacra of sensations associated with rave burnout, variously referencing DJ Screw, The Caretaker, and Mark Leckey’s collaged soundtracks in two extended works. As the old adage dictates, what goes up must come down. ‘All You Can Hold In The Falling’ acknowledges this inevitability, taking inspiration from the serotonin-depleted days after the rave when exhausted synapses are misfiring and feelings become scrambled, upended, confused and short-circuited. On the A-side’s ‘Empty Blooms Still Withering’, Dave Saved wrestles with tape techniques in a sequence of mulched events, with warped samples resembling half-remembered flashbacks and swilled in ultra slow motion, like DJ Screw with too much drank in his cup, or The Caretaker after a snifter too far. However, the dankness and smudge is tempered with pangs of lushness, as Saved proceeds to scrape the inside of his seshed-out skull and parse the spectrum of its accreted feels. NPLGNN’s B-side piece ‘Empathic New Utopia’ contrasts with a droning, almost static, steeply introspective arrangement intended as a call to action and unity in the face of chaos and unpredictability. Revolving the idea that, “The dystopia in which we are living has canceled the utopian dream by crushing people into the present. The frustration has reduced the ability to feel compassion, to act empathically”, NPLGNN conjures a strikingly isolationist sound shot thru with elusive voices and stammering recursive shudders, like souls crying out into the ether but truncated, stifled in mid air. less"

Recorded at the band’s own self-built Henwood Studio in rural Oxfordshire, the album effortlessly moves through different voices from the band’s circle. The inimitable, timeless vocals of Nubiya Brandon lead the way on the album’s title track about breaking preconceptions and promoting equality, “Where you from?

Her enchanting sounds are always an invitation to explore the most concealed nooks of our own perception. Therefore, it's not surprising to learn that, for her, music is often a way to answer some of her mental question marks. In the case of 'Urban Monogamy', this questioning refers to the diverse ways of understanding affective relationships in our time. She explains it in this way: \"A sort of Pandora's box opened up, to offer me and pretty much everyone around me, a variety of relationship forms of all kind. Polyamory, open relationships, monogamy and whatsoever. It was very confused. I think this track represents that confused time.\" The feeling is perfectly conveyed through the track's restrained but steady groove. Eva's trademark occultist melodies and breathy lyrics that are both a celebration of freedom and an acceptance that, as emotionally complex creatures, we're destined to be dazed forever when it comes to figure out our feelings for others. In their remix, Velvet Season & The Hearts Of Gold transform the mysterious charm of the track into a weapon of dance floor seduction by adding a no-frills motorik beat and beefing up it's sub-low frequencies. It's not surprising that the remix has already been played by the emperor of cosmic sleaze himself: DJ Harvey. On the flip, 'Green Healing Highness' opens another type of gates, in this case of consciousness. As Eva recalls, the track was written in just one night after an acid trip in France in which the plants in a garden had showed her \"something pure and magic\", helping her understand \"what it means to be healing\". Overall, it feels like a more radiant take in her sound, with its whimsical arpeggios and melodies adding a bucolic touch to the psychedelic journey.” less"

Stripped right back to just the composer/performer and his prepared instrument, the record’s four pieces present unflinching accounts of a grand piano being “played” unconventionally, using all manner of resonant objets laid on, stroking, or striking its strings in order to unleash its rawest inner voice. Friedl is hardly the first to experiment with prepared pianos - John Cage and the Fluxus lot got there first, and even AFX had a dabble in ‘Drukqs’ - but Friedl’s now arguably the preeminent exponent of prepared piano music (and surely a piano tuner’s worst nightmare!). As such, the title of ‘Music For Piano’ takes on greater significance, as it isn’t just concerned with its guts, but rather the whole thing, from the keys to what lies inside. Where his previous study could be hellishly abstract and aggressive, this follow-up feels more tempered and broader in scope, with gestures that recall everything from lapsteel blues guitar twang and the elegance of Korean classical court music, to the polyrhythms of Indonesian gamelan orchestras and the timbral complexities of Romanian spectralist styles. Yet, while the first three parts arguably sound like a tangle of all the above, and understandably sound acoustic (if hyperreal), the 4th and final piece generates remarkably electronic-sounding qualities as a result of Friedl’s precise E-Bow technique, and ultimately pays testament to his tenacity and skill in breaking down and reframing the very meaning of piano music. less"

Taking her name from the southern Italian method of making-do in the kitchen, Cucina Povera works just as well to describe Rossi’s unusual, off-kilter mix of avant-garde abstraction, medieval-sounding folk and synthesised nocturnal atmospheres, which sounds to our lugs like one of the Fonal label’s folk sprites gone rogue in a parallel 4th world. Strung out somewhere between Julia Holter’s enigmatic early work, the possessed vibes of Ectoplasm Girls, and a deeply strange episode of the Moomins, Rossi’s first release finds a fine balance of naif imagination and modestly confident vision, shaping a quietly hallucinatory and often ephemeral sound world where it’s dead easy to lose yourself within its maze of alternating physical and mental states. Glasgow’s Night School, behind the release, aptly compare Maria’s style with magic realism, which offers a hand catch-all explanation for wtf is going on between the sylvan synths and lullaby-like glossolalia of Demetra and the worm holing in-conclusion of Totean, with results that recall Phew’s esoteric Japanese songcrasf in the multi-tracked vox of Kuparirumpu, or like one of the enchanted cuts from Felicia Atkinson’s Hand In Hand LP on Avainsana, whilst Huhuilu is a dance anthem from alternate, lushly inverse dimensions.

   "name": "For reasons that will become lysergically clear once you’ve heard the samples, Midori Takada's sublime debut album Through The Looking Glass [1983] is widely regarded the holy grail of ‘80s Japanese ambient & minimalist music. Perhaps it’s no wonder that 2nd hand copies are known to trade for over £600, and, therefore this deluxe reissue is welcomed by a whole new generation of listeners tracing this enchanted sound back to source. Rooted in Midori Takada's fascination with Asian and African percussion traditions, Through The Looking Glass documents the Japanese musician navigating syncretic channels of practice between floating fantasy kingdoms and parallel ambient dimensions whilst guided by a deeply ethereal, oneiric spirit that’s utterly key to the album’s appeal. While it broadly falls under the ambient banner, the results are far too grand and ambitious to be considered sonic wallpaper - they’re more like widescreen tableaus that open out exponentially the deeper in you dive. The image of a Lady Godiva-like character riding a hare-sheep-horse chimera on the cover symbolises the surreal confluence of ideas and gestures within; a Japanese musician translating Victorian psychedelic fantasies into a language of rippling rhythmelodies and softly pealing harmonics that nod to Pygmy music as much as gamelan traditions, the soundtracks of Cocteau films and precise marimba patter. The rest, we’ll leave for your dilated discovery. Take it on trust that this is especially spellbinding and sui generis stuff without complete comparison. A dream. less"

How about unreleased? Susan Christie was a Philly based sophomore folk singer who had one novelty hit for a major label and never quite recovered – Afterwards, her psychedelic take on country standards and hand crafted tales of inner-city solitude backed by a break heavy folk funk rhythm section was never accepted as a commercial viabilty by record company big-wigs – They obviously couldnt quite muster their nostradamus sensibilities to forsee what future hiphop producers and DJs would be feeding into digital music-machines 30 years down the line! Luckily three-fifths of a handful (literally three!) privately pressed vanity copies were manufactured in early 1970 one of which became the source material for Finders Keepers 6th LP in their expanding library of obscure, obtuse, obsolete and obsessive vintage music from the 60s and 70s. Uber legend John Hill who penned the acid-rock floor-filler LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE for Wool and Pacific Gas And Electric produced the LP which featues 9 tracks including a Johnny Cash cover and a 12 minute drugsploitation epic called Yesterday – Where’s My Mind featuring Susan flipping vocal styles between Janis Joplin and Margo Guryan (…who was in fact a close friend of Susan’s at the time of recording).” less"

Leading on from the moody mosaic of Kent’s 2018 mix for Good Morning Tapes, ‘Secrets of Mana’ sees him and Canova outdoing each other for obscurantism at each move, as the 90 minute mix steps off with ragga chat and ultimately lands in (what sounds like) some deep, South African soul pearl via reams of seemingly unrelated, yet compelling, selections from ambient to avant-garde sound poetry and raucous gamelan. The mix’s zig-zagging logic and arrangement highlights contrasts and similarities between the far-flung regions, styles, rhythms and vibes of Mana’s label remit, which has already taken in a spectrum covering Pierre Mariétan’s ‘80s french sound art alongside concrète garage from Diptera, De Leon’s gamelan techno and the barely-hinged avant-garde folk of O Yama O.

   "name": "King Midas Sound (Kevin Martin / The Bug & Roger Robinson) deliver an exceptionally stark new album; an hour-long study of unravelling love rendered via desolate, beautiful ambient/shoegaze/concrète textures. It’s an unusual album; the vocals sitting high in the mix, the instrumentation recalling Kevin Martin’s work on Experimental Audio Research’s 'The Köner Experiment’, the atmosphere often suffocating. We’ve sunk deep into it and reckon it’s nothing short of a modern day classic, something like Tricky’s dread-filled Pre-Millennium Tension if it had been produced by Thomas Köner. Auspiciously cued for a Valentine’s Day release, ‘Solitude’ is a meditation on loss, an elegy to extinguished romance and love in the endtimes. Combining the confessional vulnerability of Robinson’s lyrics and dreader-than-dread delivery with the most stripped back arrangements in Kevin Martin’s entire catalogue, the duo drill deep into emotional sufferation with simultaneously airless, deeply moving results, glacially limning a coming-to-terms with loss. It pushes King Midas Sound’s pessimism to heart-rinsing degrees, staging Robinson in a series of vantablack scenes veiled by smoky, minimal synth-lighting, the poet processes irrational and incessant feelings of rejection and loneliness. From the aching desolation of ‘You Disappear’ to the unflinching realisations of ‘X’, the ache imparted by Robinson’s lyrics is only amplified by his quiet stoicism, something that reaches an apex on the emotionally brutal Zeros, recalling Tricky's incredible side project with Terry Hall 'Nearly God', while Kevin Martin finds power in a sense of deferred gratification and his embrace of negative space. The effect is nothing less than transfixing in the physicality of Robinson’s descriptions and the detached nature of Martin’s sferic electronics on ‘In The Night’, while pangs of lush optimism lend an exquisite contrast to the desiccated riddim and gloom of ‘Alone’, and the sylvan keys in their sensuous reverie, ’Her Body’. ‘Solitude’ is a worthy follow-up to King Midas Sound’s two albums for Hyperdub, in some senses eclipsing both in terms of distinctive, emotional impact. But more than that, it’s an album made for the times we find ourselves in; a meditation on love and loss in the age of info overload. less"

Masin's best known work, was first issued in 1986 on his private imprint, Bear In The Moon, and marked the start of a respected catalogue which has most recently flourished with his prized contributions to the Music From Memory label, including a sublime solo 2LP compilation and the Gaussian Curve album, beside his work on that brilliant Lifted LP for PAN alongside Co la and Max D. Coming from a similar place, spiritually speaking, as the pioneering ambient work of K.

   "name": "‘God’s Chorus’ is a hauntingly beautiful recording of crickets, slowed down until they resemble a keening choir of angels. The hour-long piece was made for tape in the ‘90s and subsequently extended and posted to Soundcloud in 2012, where it’s currently received over 8.5 million plays. Jonny Trunk stumbled across the piece in 2014 (when it already had millions of plays), and within days had signed it for a vinyl issue on Trunk. It’s taken until 2018 for the full release because Jonny initially couldn’t decide on artwork, but he’s evidently found the ideal cover here in 14 year old Bess Kirby’s super charming, felt-tip depiction of a kaleidoscopic cricket. When Trunk discovered the track online, he was struck by the cynicism of the comments left below the line, with many expressing disbelief, or thinking that the work is a con or manufactured to sound like this. It’s maybe easy to hear why many may think so - it does sound like some holy missive despatched from the firmament - but as anyone with scant knowledge of nature recordings will be aware, deeply uncanny sounds do emerge from the natural world, once we’ve slowed it down enough to be able to perceive its complexities. In fact, the LP pairs two recordings of crickets, layering the slowed down (but not manipulated) recording over the normal speed version. In context of their original home, a CD of Native American “animal lore”, it may be easy enough to suspend disbelief at what one’s hearing, and go along with it - as we are, thanks to a little knowledge of how sound works when slowed - but fair enough for any casual listeners to not believe their ears that crickets in a field can sound like an opiated, seraphic chorale. Either way, Jonny sums it up neatly: “Real or fake? True or false? I care not, as it sure sounds like crickets to me, and it sure does sound amazing” less"

   "name": "This tape is basically as weird and hard to place as its cover suggests. It’s an impressionistic ‘radio tale’ describing private listening life conducted in Albania under the totalitarian communist rule of Enver Hoxha (1944-1985), whose restrictive regime meant that radio become the sole source of connection to the world beyond Albania’s borders. It was made by Jonida Prifti, documenting her own experience living and documenting under that regime. You don’t need to have experienced the same repression to understand the pathos and raw, alien wonder of her hauntoligcally-related recording, which lands somewhere between the haunting electro-acoustic documentations of Áine O’Dwyer, alien radio transmissions, and the kind of spectral enigmas released by Venetian label Von Archive. Part of the latest batch from Canti Magnetici - the esoteric young label operated by Gaspare Sammartano, Andrea Penso and Loopy’s Donato Epiro from an area in South Italy across the Adriatic from Albania - Acchiappashpirt Tola is a steeply abstract incursion to Jonida’s formative years, sharing, in her own words, “the tale of a girl who discovers freedom through the frequencies of a radio” - a medium which was forbidden, and only legitimately accessible to those who supported the regime. Tuning into indecipherable ‘“foreign” frequencies’ was therefore both a form of resistance and exploration which, although ostensibly simple and passive, clearly had a powerful impact on the young woman who “felt sucked in by the radio waves until I disappeared into the frequencies”, calling it “a kind of metamorphosis from human being to a free pure wave without boundaries”. Starkly greyscale and billowing with negative space, the 23 minute piece opens with a dramaturgy of primitive electronics and voice, with bleeps and distant Italian vocals establishing widely reverberant, hard-to-grasp dimensions perfused by acousmatic disturbances and thrilling in their pranging, unpredictable and operatic nature. At around the half way mark percussion joins the mix in a way recalling the early electronic poems of Edgar Varèse, tumbling into stilted syncopations and sharing dusty space with wistful, prodding organ notes in a way just like Áine O’Dwyer’s Music For Cleaners. It’s rare and quite shocking to find music so astute and bold in its primitiveness, at once reminding us of similarities between our own formative fiddling with tuning dials and the rawness of early electronic recordings. And that’s where the blank B-side comes into play, intended for listeners to fill up the space with their own recordings, in a way getting back in touch with what made music and sound at the rawest level so seductive, alien and key to all of our listening lives. less"

Domestic Economy displays two eventful sides evidencing the unique musical approach Shakespeare has developed in such a short period of time. Let’s get some facts straight, Finlay is young.

His programming skills belie his years and one can detect a sharp appreciation of historical electronic pop whilst simultaneously developing a canny understanding as to where such a form exists in the current age. Shakespeare’s brazen lyrical content and significant melodic prowess highlight a brave new voice in what can often be an sterile aesthetic environment. Domestic Economy bursts with edgy ecstatic electronic pop. A form not only unusual for Editions Mego (actually known for idolising such forms) but somewhat of a scarcity amongst the modern electronic landscape.

You might pardon our excitement at this sound when it soon comes into combination with his vocals and patented chord cadence, letting us all know that this isn’t some decadent attempt at reenacting old soul glories or slopping on the gloss to mask a formula - he’s speaking from here and now, seemingly singing a modern bluez down a Skype connection. Most brilliantly, that fidelity also apples to the rest of the album, with Spacek’s trademark falsetto sweetly occluded in-the-mix, smudged with wickedly slouching, gunky bass funk and the “cheapest” sounding drums. As we said, the effect is felt best in his mesmerisingly unique opener ‘Natural Sci Fi’, but we’re also smitten with the album’s other standouts, such as the grubbing acid funk and in-the-pocket harmonies of ‘Carnival Nights’, and the combination of sloshing, off-key arps and languorous vox on ’Shout’.

The Contraposition EP marks Warp Records’ timely return to its SoYo roots in a concerted refresh of bleep techno and soundsystem ballistics, rendering the original template as a corrupted 3D geometry of slippery chromatic contours and polyrhythmic chronics that feel lightyears removed from their early ‘90s and early ‘00s antecedents, yet patently in key with their stripped down design and rave-wrecking purpose. A-side, Rian focusses a wickedly nervous 2-step energy into the pointillist shadow-boxing tekkers of Contra_A1, strongly recalling his work on two preceding EPs for The Death of Rave, before then testing out something new and dynamically different with the punchy recoil and canny use of echoic negative space on Contra_A2, which all leads to a deadly acid switch-up in the 2nd half. On the B-side he reconfigures your swang schauung with a mad meld of skittish micro rhythms and cold as f**k Euro-techno motifs on Position_B1, then like Errorsmith describing Equinknoxx swatting a nano-drone with the incisive, anticipatory bait and slap of Position_B2.

   "name": "10 years on from Panda Bear’s modern classic ‘Person Pitch’, Noah Lennox meets that album’s engineer Rusty Santos for a singular new album of experimental pop music embracing new technology while staying true to classic pop feels. It’s almost like a Jamaican riddim album, with most songs making foundational use of deep subbass beds and processed acoustic guitar in subtle variations - always the same, always different. Warning - you’ll be missing half the fun with his one if you have shit speakers! “The first song to be released from Buoys is “Dolphin”: Lennox’s bright, sincere voice front and center, with miles of space surrounding it, a guitar and some textured samples fleshing out the dubby sparseness and undercurrent of speaker-limit-pushing sub-bass low-end. Buoys was co-produced and co-mixed by collaborator Rusty Santos in Lennox’s adopted home of Lisbon, Portugal. Lennox and Santos last collaborated on the landmark Panda Bear album Person Pitch, which had its 10-year anniversary last year. Animated by their ongoing interest in contemporary music production techniques, Lennox and Santos envisioned something that would “feel familiar to a young person’s ears.” However, Buoys retains a deep layer of experimentation coursing through the hyper-modern production – a hallmark of Panda Bear releases that will feel intimately familiar to fans of Lennox’s decade-plus body of work. Alongside Santos, Buoys also features collaborators in Chilean DJ/vocalist Lizz and Portuguese musician Dino D'Santiago, both artists who came to Lennox via Santos’ recent trap and reggaeton production work; the former contributes arrangements throughout the album including “Dolphin,” and both lend their vocals to “Inner Monologue.\" Buoys is the first Panda Bear release since 2018's vinyl-only EP A Day With the Homies, and the follow-up to 2015's kaleidoscopic full-length Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper. \"The last three records felt like a chapter to me, and this feels like the beginning of something new,\" says Lennox whilst surveying how Buoys relates to the estimable Panda Bear catalogue. Indeed, the forthcoming Buoys is full of fresh ideas from one of modern music's most fascinating, innovative, and emotionally generous artists.” less"

In effect, these are the latest examples of Nkisi’s unique form of up-to-the-minute, mutant folk music; four mutable grooves that twist the bones of later ‘90s brutalist aerobic mysticism between the Hecate or Christoph De Babalon-esque gloom of The Dark Orchestra and the brittle syncopation of Violent Tendencies on the A-side, and over to the ravenous Cold Rush cavalcade of G.E.O. and her frenetic, pitching stepper, Dark Noise.

It starts up gingerly with the stumbling ephemera of ‘Vivi-Q Flight Path’, but finds it feet in slow, rolling structures that drift from soggy dub in ‘Orbitiara’ to the blunted, crackling jag of ‘Nick and Kev Set Controls for The waning Moon’ with Mr. Beatnik, and brilliantly shapeshifting into more asymmetric structures with the vaporous yet angular swang of ‘Unfathomed States’ and a pulsating abstract named ‘Extinct Song’.

Flitting between the dreamworld of hauntological synth music and hypnotic techno functionality, Still Waves To Whisper showcases James Place's continuing development of dramatic (and varied) sound worlds. Musically, Still Waves To A Whisper contains both some of the most immediately danceable and straight up beautiful tracks of James Place's career. Utilising voice samples from the same source as his last album, Voices Bloom, opener 'Known Cry' is a heavenly coda of sunlight bursting through clouds, warm synths drifting across restrained pulses. 'Timing and Lighting' went through countless live iterations before the current version was tracked for this album, a tunneling exploration of rhythm with a dose of sardonic humor. 'Move In Blue (Homeward Mix)' is James Places' rework of a track from 2017's Voices Bloom, obsessively remixed and revisited, here littered with additional melodies and populated by newly sampled voices. Closing track 'Names' is perhaps the most outright beautiful James Place recording to date. A stripped back rework of a live version of Living On Superstition’s 'Another Mourning In America', the tune is based on a melodic line written after the studio recorded version. Interwoven with a sampled vocal, and rinsed of all of the original song, 'Names' is left behind a stark and compelling descendant. The digital release includes a remix of 'Move In Blue' by Persuasion aka Devon Hansen. The title, Still Waves To A Whisper, stems from a conversation between Place and another artist on methods to ease anxieties and the benefits of a focused practice. The hope's for this music to continue that conversation on a larger scale.” less"

I like to enjoy myself.” – Simon Pomery, London, 28 December 2018. Blood Music is Simon Pomery: London-based, Irish-born producer, musician and maker of the “infinity-poem”. The name Blood Music is one English translation of the Japanese word “Kodo”: “mind-before-thought”, “children of the drum”, “music heard in the womb”, or rather, “blood music”. He has two 12”s on Diagonal Records – “Blood Music EP” (2013), and “Chicks/Badgering” (2015) – digis on dingn\\dents and self-released works. “GPS Poetics” is influenced by Pomery’s research into poetics and ethics: Fred Moten’s writings on poetry and improvisation from “In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition”, Joan Retallack on Gertrude Stein, John Cage and aleatoric composition in “The Poethical Wager”, and Édouard Glissant’s “Poetics of Relation”. The notion of “the centre” is exploded in favour of fugitive research into the relational. The result here is a live mix of cross-genre blood musics, given to that most freely proliferating, streamable, downloadable, capitalist communication of consumer taste: the DJ mixtape. Pomery’s use of text and voice in Blood Music continues his investigation of text-sound compositions of the 60s and 70s. His “infinity poems”, which are algorithmically produced for print as well as for his a/v show “SPEED READING WITH BLOOD MUSIC”, provide the visual art and language for his relational poetics.” less"

Intrigued by the egalitarian feminist principles set forth in the Manifesto, I wanted to incorporate them in the structure of a new piece that I was composing. The women’s movement was surfacing and I felt the need to express my resonance with this energy. Marilyn Monroe had taken her own life. Valerie Solanas had attempted to take the life of Andy Warhol. Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality: Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress. Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work. Commissioned by the Music Department of Hope College, Holland Michigan, To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation had its premiere in 1970. Though everyone knew Marilyn Monroe hardly anyone recognized Valerie Solanas or took her Manifesto seriously. I brought the names of these two women together in the title of the piece to draw attention to their inequality and to dedicate the piece.” – Pauline Oliveros.” less"

   "name": "’Scaffold Eyes’ is a slow moving and intimately evocative audioplay written and recorded by Berlin-based sound artist Armin Lorenz Gerold, with additional vocals by art/architecture historian Miriam Stoney and Irish filmmaker Doireann O’Malley “Produced in November 2017 for KW Institute for Contemporary Art’s Compound series, Armin Lorenz Gerold’s ‘Scaffold Eyes’ is a 45 minute audioplay, first presented as a multi-channel installation and a live reading performance. It is narrated by Gerold alongside London-based art and architecture historian Miriam Stoney and Berlin-based artist and filmmaker Doireann O’Malley. ‘It is a Tuesday evening in late August. She wanders through various streets linked to a canal that divides the district in two halves. Her thoughts are diffuse and further interrupted by looking at her phone relentlessly.’ ‘Scaffold Eyes’ traces the paths of four characters as they wander through the urban landscape of Berlin. We listen in to their meandering thoughts. The lines they walk are never straight, their narrated memories and observations oscillating between the diffuse and the precise. Berlin’s cityscape echoes their psychological space, its dimensions distorted. The city’s sounds blend into each other. Scaffold is everywhere. In juxtaposing the constant reshaping of this metropole with the transient lives of his characters, Gerold places us into a world seemingly in flux. ‘It is early September. I enter Kreuzberg 61’s town hall through the main entrance passing by a porters’ lodge A man is barely visible behind glass. Gently lit from the side by a small table lamp, half his shape disappears…’ The compositions seem algorithmic, yet mood-driven and fluid. Gerold combines spoken word with a collage of field recordings, ambient compositions and song sketches. For example, the faux-jazz of ‘Love Theme of Scaffold Eyes’ suggests a film noir theme while resonating with a characters’ depiction of construction sites by night. As we follow a character into an uninhabited highway construction site, we listen to his voice shifting gradually into vocoder, glancing a the autobahn superstructures around us, cars streaming by. “ less"

The album's nine tracks eschew the pulse and rhythm that defined the duo's previous effort (II: Plains/Patterns) in favor of sparse melodic possibilities and a more abstract palette of sounds. Chroma/Contour suggests looking both 20 years forward and twenty years back, while forgetting the present altogether. Much of the album plays out as a study in minimalism: the texture and colour of each sound is being explored in miniscule detail, with enough space in the soundfield to allow each sonic constituent to breathe fully. There's a conceptual dimension to several tracks on the album, with guitars, analog synths and voices being mangled by samplers, computer software and a broken dictaphone into pure abstraction. But simultaneously there's a melodic undercurrent, revealing a deeply emotional aspect of the music. Tracks such as Color In The Six, Iris and Soft Logic convey a melancholic sense of awe, a profoundly calming glimpse of the sublime.” less"

In her words; ; “It’s the only album I’ve made that is an all-encompassing statement expressing the totality of my being. A sense of the past in relation to the presents and everything in between.” Rather than explicitly referencing any one period of her oeuvre, which stretches back to the early ‘70s and covers everything from performance art to video works and numerous stylistic shifts in contemporary music, Cosey limns a more elusive silhouette of her stunning body of work in ’Tutti’, rendering an amorphous mass that conveys the absorbingly sensual nature and breadth of her scope. It’s strong testament to her holistic approach, or even her influence over successive generations, that the music on ‘Tutti’ sounds like it could have been made at any point between her debut album and right now. Kicking off with the mechanical jazz fonk of ‘Tutti’, with her sky-high signature cornet scudding over primeval techno rhythms, the set twists from writhing electrosex in ‘Drone’ and the mantric hypnosis of ‘Sophic Ripple’, to investigate accreted layers of ghostly psychic plasma in the psychoactive sound design of ‘Split’, before finding her traumas voice in the sexy AF synth-pop abstraction ‘Heliy’, while the depths of ‘Orenda’ could be said to hearken as much to the blue/black churn of the North Sea next to her native Hull as much as the noise ideologies of TG and a shared sense of solidarity with marginalised people (the title is an Iroquois word for a spiritual power inherent in people and their environment). less"

RIYL Valerio Tricoli, Reinhold Friedl, Russel Haswell “CRACKFINDER the album comprises of two distinct parts. The first is extremely intense and eventful, creating a strong tension, giving the sense of an immense effort or even wrestling between the musicians; a clash of ideas and values. This dialog is not monotonous but dynamic, full of changing and new hypotheses – as if in a process of reaching the truth. We can suppose that these investigated issues are philosophical and existential, giving the impression of greatness and overwhelming significance. The second part evokes a kind of a soothing stabilization. One may think that the interlocutors have reached a consensus. However, no-one is celebrating, and the mood is somewhat melancholic. The discovery proved to be depressing and the truth is not liberating – it becomes a burden. There is a poignant feeling of failure or unfulfilment, despite concluding and solving the task. Finally, we are left with silence, and even emptiness – with a symbolic and absolute dimension of the end. The effort of the first part, motivated by the conviction of the significance and need for proving something, is confronted with the disillusion brought by the end of the road. The effort, however, was not in vain – the discovery of the truth, although painful, can be purifying. The album offers more interpretative hints than just its expressive title. The artwork on the cover is a frame from the video art piece ENJOY THE SILENCE by Anna Zaradny: symbolic flares and cracking of matter in complete silence. The intensity of the image, however, creates a strong suggestion of sound. The back of the sleeve is spread with photos of the musicians holding the #BLACKPROTEST banner, in remembrance of the wave of pro-choice protests in Poland in 2016. Cracks – both material and metaphorical – do not have to be the negative effect of an abrupt event. They can be the beginning of change, an opening for the new, an impulse for action. It is, therefore, worth continuing the search for the 'portals of change’.” less"

   "name": "Yves Tumor lands on Warp with his debut album for the label; more popwise and polished than before, still pitched perfectly between the avant garde and the mass market... Laced with guest vox and production from Croatian Amor, James Ferraro, Oxhy, Puce Mary and James K, on ‘Safe In The Hands of Love’ Sean Bowie a.k.a. Yves Tumor is the liminal, connecting spirit between a unique push ’n pull of samples and original instrumentation, acting like a porous transducer of style, tone and pattern that absorbs and amplifies lost (but not dead) light and energy and turns it into something wholly his own. Where previous singles such as ‘Noid’, ‘Lifetime’ and ‘Licking An Orchid’ - the album’s core trio - distinctly nodded to Brit-pop and ‘90s ambient-pop pastoralism, the rest of the album curiously unfolds along those axes to take in nods to Warp’s earliest signings, N.O.W. on the introductory fanfare of ‘Faith In Nothing Except Salvation’, while ‘Economy Of Freedom’ opens out into futurist sci-fi soul, and ‘Honesty’ masterfully melds indie-pop and rugged electro-soul. And it’s that polysemous definition of soul that continues to be the uniting ligature or filament to the rest of the album, from the raging black metal mutation of ‘Hope In Suffering (Escaping Oblivion & Overcoming Powerlessness)’, to big beat-y psychedelia of ‘All The Love We Have Now’, and the white hot, foaming shoegaze distortion of ‘Let The Lioness In You Flow Freely’, all cannily highlighting a sense of emotive mutualism that transcends style, credo, and vibe. less"

After reviving the StabUdown moniker in 2017 with the ‘Classic Slacker Anthems’ mixtape and and a split EP with Kohler, Jimmy Donadio a.k.a. Prostitutes now takes the opportunity to indulge the more eye-fluttering, sweetboy side of ‘90s dance music in his ruggedly cubist fashion. Marking his follow-up to 2017’s ‘Dance Tracksz’ for Diagonal, ‘Strange Rabbits’ sees him switch tack to the “other” room of the club, a now near-mythical space where DJs (usually in advanced stages of baldness) would pick and mix tracks meant to to provide a more hypnotic, seductive experience than all-out peaktime pressure of the main rooms. Nowadays, if there’s a 2nd room, it’s more likely just another shade of house, maybe slightly slower, but back then those rooms were incubators for alternative vibes, what is commonly known now as ambient music. While not strictly ambient in the wallpaper sense of the word, in ’Strange Rabbits’ he uses that vibe to soften the edges of his sound, resulting a super endearing sequence of events between the heavy rollin’ house of ‘Teenage Scream Dreamer’ at the front and The Field-esque frayed loops of ‘Koln Alone’ that close the album. In between you’ll find delectable takes on Detroit techno and UK AI in ‘Wizard Upholstery’, shimmering slow techno in the balmy beauty of ‘Totally Coral Reefer’, and utterly charming new age house in ‘Phased ’n Diffused’, while the likes of ‘Warm Woods’ and ‘Pool Jumper’ put some electroid funk in your pipe. Anyone hoping for a noisy razz-out from ‘Strange Rabbits’ should expect to receive a sweaty, loved-up embrace instead. Class artwork by Guy Featherstone as standard. less"

Previously only available as a download, the live show was self-released by HTRK on the first anniversary of the death of Sean Stewart (✝18.03.10), It renders a definitive early portrait of the group, just before they broke into a wider conciseness with ‘Marry Me, Tonight’ for Blast First Petite a year later. As such, it captures their raw, sophisticated angst bleeding out between the sluggish lurch of ‘Look What’s Been Done’, the prurient swerve of ‘Panties’ and their VU-channelling dirge, ‘Kiss Before The Fall’, all in sequence with deathrock crawl of ‘Waltz Real Slow’,the knackered drum machines of ‘Fascinator’, and the asphyxiating heaviness of ‘I’m All Broke Up’, all delivered mantra-like and detectably under the influence of something stronger than a cup of tea. The performance was in support of Lydia Lunch, and the following passage gives some flavour of the atmosphere: “The entire night was filmed by Meerak Meinohg from the foot of the stage, resulting in a suitably fucked-up fidelity. This was a memorable night of attraction and repulsion in the concrete warehouse surrounds of Corsica Studios. Lydia put on an incredibly divisive show, forcing a visible split - the straight guys either retreated to the bar or left the venue, leaving the queers and femmes transfixed at the front, kissing her feet! HTRK's typically dimly lit show rendered the film footage totally unwatchable, but the audio stands alone and is here deemed worthy of release by the band. The sound, by turns, is shadowy, tough and twisted, with the trio high as kites. If you know the songs, you will love this set.\" less"

RIYL Marcus Schmickler, Cam Deas, Kevin Drumm “Born in 1977, Thomas Mahmoud is a Berlin based cross-disciplinary artist – musician, sound designer, performer, author and radioplay producer. Since stepping down as the singer with Cologne based band Von Spar (L’age d’or, Tomlab), he has pursued his interests in deconstructing sounds, using analogue and digital tools to work with textures and field recordings.

   "name": "Akira Rabelais’ years-in-the-making new album CXVI, featuring collaborations with Harold Budd, Ben Frost, Biosphere, Kassel Jaeger and Stephan Mathieu, among others. It unfurls a quietly breathtaking, dreamlike sequence of events where early music meets a prism of shoegaze, ASMR, classical and textural sound design - huge recommemdation if yr into Felicia Atkinson, the GRM, Morton Feldman, Stephan Mathieu, Deathprod, Harold Budd... Set to be received as Rabelais' magnum opus, ‘CXVI’ finds the Hollywood-based composer challenging his usual working methods, pushing himself to refresh binds with longterm collaborators such as Harold Budd and Stephan Mathieu and forge new relationships with like-minded craftsmen such as Geir Jenssen (Biosphere), while also finding a new vocal muse in Karen Vogt of Heligoland, and also coaxing the recorded debuts of his friend Mélanie Skriabine, and filmmaker/photographer Bogdan D. Smith. The result of their time-lapsed endeavours is a record of divine subtlety and poignant patience, rendered with a mirage-like appeal. Opener ‘Which Alters When It Alteration Finds’, beautifully segues from a prickly bouquet of keys and lovebite-distortion penned with Ben Frost to a reverberant, spine-freezing piano coda from Harold Budd, before ‘Which Alters When It Alteration Finds’ smokily gives way to the sylvan shadowplay of the album’s masterful centrepiece, ‘Star to Every Wandring Worth’s Unknown’, where Mélanie Skriabine reads from Max Ernst’s ‘la femme 100 têtes’ against an exquisite veil of strings and keys realised by Akira with the GRM’s Kassel Jaeger a.k.a. François Bonnet. The 3rd part of the album only becomes more sparse and isolationist, as Karen Vogt’s plainsong gives way to the tremulous, icy timbres of Akira’s processed guitar strokes, originally written for Cedrick Corliolis’ ’Tokyo Platform’ soundtrack, before the final side of ‘If Error and Upon Me Proved’ finds Akira pushing Geir Jenssen’s (Biosphere) synths into the red, emphasising a romantic soreness that turns into crushing noise, before Bogdan Smith’s whispered vocal melts into an ancient, arcane air inscribed to 78rpm vinyl by Stephan Mathieu and then sweetened, re-incoporated by Akira as the album’s stunning closing passage. Riddled with bedevilling detail and utterly timeless in its scope, ’CXVI’ is a disorientating opus you’ll want to undergo over and again, for our money one of the great quiet albums of recent years. less"

   "name": "Best known as one half of Deaf Center, Erik K. Skodvin's work as Svarte Greiner has been described as \"acoustic doom\" by those with a genre-delineated filing system, and his best known work 'Knive' is now made available on vinyl for the first time since its original release over a decade ago. \"11 years since it´s inception, the surreal and darkly romantic Knive still sounds like a mystery and something that´s hard to pin down. Svarte Greiner´s debut album feels like a trip into the forest at midnight, with all the sounds and impressions that comes with it. Spiritual, horrific and fragile in essence, it´s melancholic core is hard to shake off, and feels as present today as it did back then. While starting off the sub genre of “Accoustic doom” back in 2006, it´s difficult to say what else to name it now, with it´s inspiration and elements from countless genres. The record flows through the dissonant cello´s and washed out vocals of “Ocean out of Wood” past the introverted church organs of “The Black Dress”, distorted guitars and wooden beats of “The Dining Table” to the operatic finalé of “Final Sleep”. Everything scattered with field recordings from crows, branches, walking, sleeping, rain, wind and who knows what. Knive stands on many feet, wherever they may be. Erik K Skodvin´s path as Svarte Greiner have since been dwelling more and more into this world, picking each element apart to focus on them, stretching them out or cutting them down, looping, experimenting and flooding with reverb - trying to make time stop and night fall. But for now a re-visit to where it all started seems appropriate. 'Knive' sees Skodvin plundering a record collection evidently stacked with the likes of Earth, Badalamenti and Volcano The Bear - coming out the other side with a record that is inky black without becoming oppressive or claustrophobic. Opening with the melted-wax drones of 'The Boat Was My Friend', Svarte Greiner presents an inky arena to experience his music - as crepuscular cello and detached vocals coalesce to forge an ethereal and otherworldly aesthetic. Flecked with pathos and a genuine sense of foreboding, 'The Boat Was My Friend' signals the coming record in a dipping style which evokes images of a late night radio signals heard through a haunted woodland. Moving on from here, 'Ocean Out Of Wood' is a mealy and waterlogged affair, wherein Skodvin allows creaking percussion and pregnant chords to seep into the conscious with just the right balance of light and dark to ensure the textures never become too abrasive or oppressive. Bringing to mind a tarnished copper-rub, the likes of 'My Feet Over There', 'An Ordinary Hike' and 'The Black Dress' all inhabit a musical sphere where shadows are encouraged and light is shunned to piquant effect. Elsewhere, the stunning finale of 'Final Sleep' is heaving with operatics that scar the conscious through cavernous organs straight from Badalamenti's secret chest, 'The Dining Table' lays on a spread of syrupy percussion, whilst 'Ullsokk' allows haunting vocals to chide at the skittering rhythms beneath.\" less"

Hard to believe it's over 15 years old now, and still a guiding light... One of James Stinson’s most sought-after classics bubbles up again on Warp after many years at the top of everyone’s wants list. If it’s felt a bit breezy recently, that would be the collective sign of relief from techno fiends the world over at the announcement of its reissue. Originally issued as the 3rd Drexciyan Storm in 2001 - one year before Stinson’s death due to heart complications, on 3rd September, 2002 - The Other People Place’s Lifestyles of the Laptop Café became an instant classic with Detroit house and techno lovers as well as for many listeners beyond that paradigm who were equally seduced to its sleek, louche arrangements and unforgettable tunes. 15 years later it still stands as a beautifully sore thumb in the Drexciyan catalogue; far more mellow, sublime than anything else produced during James Stinson’s too short tenure on this planet, and framed by a neon glow which uniquely phosphoresces in the mind long after the needle hits the run-out. Nowadays it is justifiably elevated to the level of a peerless modern classic - a masterclass in sophisticated, futuristic electro-soul whose cultural cache has only grown exponentially since its first release, ultimately transcending time and space like few other records.

At the point where Broadcast could have easily self-combusted after the departure of half its members, the remaining duo of Trish Keenan and James Cargill instead went on to write their most stripped down and unusual album. The palette was shocking at the time; reducing their rich, cinematic tapestries to a bare-boned arrangement of drum machine, guitar and synth - far removed from the widescreen wonders they were known for. It’s a conceit that should have seen them fall flat - it’s been tried a million times - but instead the reduction allowed the songs themselves to shine. And boy what songs they are; once heard - never forgotten.

   "name": "Laraaji meets ’log(m) in a super breezy and dub-sprung collaboration for Glasgow’s Invisible, Inc. Fire up the incense and make yourself comfortable, this one’s for the easy chair kru! “It's been over a decade since Laraaji first joined forces with log(m) in their Canadian studio in early 2007. In those ten years the trio recorded several hours of music. Over time these recordings, the majority starting life as live jams, were polished, dissected, processed, re-arranged and then finely and painstakingly distilled down to the 105 minutes of music that form the basis of this album, which finally reached completion just earlier this year. The wait has been more than worth it. The Onrush Of Eternity is a melding of minds like no other. Ever the pioneer of experimental ambience, Laraaji's signature hammered dulcimer, zither, mbira, sruthi drone box and exceedingly positive vibes are here combined with log(m)'s unique vision of gronky hi-tech psychedelic space dub. The resultant voyage into deeply meditative ambience and trance-inducing dub is as unexpected an outcome as it is a bona fide \"Eureka\" moment. It sounds neither like log(m) OR Laraaji....but of course like both. It is one of those rare collaborations that is, without a doubt, even greater than the sum of its already great parts. Log(m) started making waves in the early '90s as Legion Of Green Men with their visually striking 12\"s, complete with eternal opuscules (locked grooves) and mathematically inspired titles, all lovingly issued on their own Post Contemporary imprint. These deservedly got the attention of Richie Hawtin who promptly asked the duo for an album on his own classic Plus 8 Records. 20+ years later and the music (much like their name) has morphed into something more sophisticated: even more complex, atmospheric and deeper than ever. Laraaji's reputation of course precedes him: he first came to wider attention when Brian Eno released his \"Day Of Radiance\" as part 3 of his Ambient Series in 1980. Since then, Laraaji has released over 40 albums, yet his stellar path seems still to be on the ascendant - a recent landmark being the 2017 \"Sun\" series of albums for the wonderful All Saints' Records.” less"

   "name": "Two of Annea Lockwood's dramatic works dealing with issues of spiritual wholeness. \"Duende (1997) (24:57), about shamanic transformation, is written with and performed by Thomas Buckner. Lockwood selected sounds which reminded her of certain vocal transformations heard in recordings of shamanic ceremonies. In such singing, changes in the voice mirror and also help to bring about changes in the singer's mind and awareness. Within an improvisational framework, Buckner explores the possibility of change of state through such transformations, moving through three stages: preparation, a first flight, and a final flight in which he moves beyond the self he knows. Thus Duende is a not a prepared, performed work, but a vehicle for experience. Buckner is partnered by a tape drawn from the sounds of the cuica (an African and South American instrument), a large glass gong and other glass sounds, wind, a Cameroonian rattle, a kea (New Zealand mountain parrot), and a bullroarer. Delta Run (1982) (25:38) is an expression of the thoughts and experiences of a sculptor who talked with Lockwood just over a day before he died in 1979, aged thirty. He knew that he was dying and wanted to communicate his perceptions of death as something \"only natural, you know - now is my time\", seeing this piece as a form of continuing creativity now that sculpture was out of reach. Interwoven with his voice are wind, water, ambient sounds from the hospice where they talked, and some of the ordinary sounds of daily living, embodying the sense that dying is a part of living, not separate from it, and that in dying we are incorporated back into the elements from which we emanate.\" less"

   "name": "Nick Klein puts his back into five densely-packed and stressed EBM/industrial mutations for the cats at BANK Records NYC, following their recent aces by E-Saggila and Drew McDowell X Hiro Kone. “Nick Klein is an artist making electronic music born in southern Florida and based in Brooklyn, New York since 2012. Upon moving to New York the concentration of his works output has been to mine and investigate the troped qualities in various forms of electronic music, and then to realize singular directions in how to communicate these ideas himself. Alongside Miguel Alvariño he runs the music imprint Primitive Languages. His latest offering since the January 2018 EP \"Lowered Flaming Coffin\" (Alter) is a continuation of his burnt dance music explorations with \"The Bathroom Wall\" on Bank Records. As a totem to reflect onto with text, to rest ones eyes in blur, or to physically hold ones self up in the throes of intoxication, the bathroom wall takes and gives numerous gestures of use. Klein uses the symbology of the bathroom wall to construct five disparate wall scrawlings and hazed meditations into the compositional grounds for four meaner mid-tempo, rhythmic purges. Tracks \"The Worst Band In The World\" and \"American Gut\" take on the pulsing build of an intoxicated night out. The record divides in on and itself in tone with \"Rather Be Your Enemy\", an homage in title to the legendary Lee Hazelwood song, wherein the synthesizer convulses slowly conjuring the bleaker qualities of tinnitus taking the lead over your senses. Side B of the record throbs quickly with the blown bass drums and hissing rhythms of \"Pushing Your Luck\" and comes to a drawn conclusion with the ten minute come-down at sun rise burner of \"Poor Me Another\". The record was recorded using a modular synthesizer to tape by Nick Klein and mastered by Josh Bonati.” less"

After a classic artistic journey and an experimental stint with Aktuala and other brilliant fellow musicians (like Franco Battiato, above all), Lino Capra Vaccina, near the end of the 70s, recorded Antico Adagio. It was an amazing album, anticipating countless future experiments in the field of new age and world music but also in avantgarde and electronic music. Apart from a few violin parts and the extraordinary vocal lines (sung by Vaccina himself and Juri Camisasca), Antico Adagio is an album fully built on percussions. But, at the same time, it's the farthest thing from the typical idea of percussions. You won't find a single trace of African or primitive beats: instead, this is a collection of rather long, subtle and thoughtful compositions, crafted with vibraphones, marimbas and gong. Together they create a work which will remain unique – both in Capra Vaccina's discography as well as in a more general sense.\" less"

   "name": "Outstanding suite of pitching, avant-pop expressions. “Varispeed Etudes was conceived by revered, quixotic, Glasgow-based avant-garde populist Richard Youngs very much as an analogue ‘record of two halves’ in the spirit of David Bowie’s Low and Heaven 17’s Penthouse and Pavement. Side A showcases his bent for electronic experimentation and those inimitable, hauntingly reedy, standard English vocal tones that have placed him squarely alongside a peer group of British vocalising weirdos that includes Robert Wyatt, Ivor Cutler and Charles Hayward. Side B strips away the vocals and replaces the electronics with a series of shorter, dissonant, slow-moving, acoustic clatterbang soundscapes. The whole thing is ‘held together by the joy of varispeed pitch control – major delight of reel-to-reel recording’ and it’s as rich, conceptually oblique, throwaway but important as anything in Youngs’s catalogue.

Featuring the voices of Robert Ashley, Sam Ashley, Thomas Buckner, Jackie Humbert, and Joan La Barbara. Recorded and mixed by Tom Hamilton. \"Your Money My Life Goodbye is one of forty-nine vocal-ensemble pieces of various lengths (from 10 minutes to 90 minutes or more) that can be used in many kinds of combinations to make an opera for stage, for radio or for television. Any of the combinations go under the title of the \"opera,\" The Immortality Songs. When any of the pieces are performed separately, as in Your Money My Life Goodbye for Bayerischer Rundfunk, they take their individual titles. I have finished seven of the compositions. It looks like a lifetime of work. Hence, the title. In all of the forty-nine compositions some aspect of the musical structure (or many aspects of the musical structure) derive directly from the English language of the libretto. This process of derivation can be secretive and arcane (the music based, for instance, on grammatical structures or on the probability of the recurrence of certain syllables) or, as in Your Money My Life Goodbye, open and obvious. I think that the open and obvious approach - in this case, matching the syllables of the English (and the German) to the rhythm of the title-line, and matching the voice choices to the occurrence of the \"characters\" in the text - is a good solution to the \"light-hearted\" nature of the text. The story is simple. A woman responds to an invitation to attend a high-school reunion by sending her son, because she is incapacitated for some unknown reason. In describing her son, we get the idea that he is a high-level \"intelligence agent\" (a spy). A sort of James Bond character. The woman writes that her son's wife will not attend the reunion, because she is recently dead, either from suicide or murder. The son's wife is described in great detail from various newspaper articles. She was an internationally renowned swindler, who almost took down the European and American banking system. She was a successful entrepreneur. Your Money My Life Goodbye doesn't take this seriously at all. Everybody is crazy.\" — Robert Ashley, 1998 less"

   "name": "Keith Hudson, the dub dentist, was a one-off innovator with impeccable, classical lineage: his first studio recording involved former Skatalites; his earliest releases provided solid-gold hits for Ken Boothe's \"Old Fashioned Way\" as far back as John Holt, Delroy Wilson, U-Roy and the rest. Like \"Lloyd\" Bullwackies Barnes, his collaborator here - his split from this tradition is dynamic and all his own: Hudson's mature music finds its optimum conditions away from Jamaica, in London and New York studios and for less didactic transatlantic audiences, while his dark experimentalism becomes increasingly better suited to the the LP and extended 12\" than the cardinal 7\" reggae format. Original dark disco mixes from the middle>> latter seventies, drenched in the essences of deepest afro-american-jamaican funk jams. \"Playing It Cool & Playing It Right\" was released in 1981 on Hudson's own, american based Joint International label. It was originally intended that one of Hudson's teenage sons would voice the dubs: in the event the Love Joys, Wayne Jarrett, and inimitably Hudson himself featured at the microphone. Like Wackies, Hudson was a Studio One devotee \"I used to hold Don Drummond's trombone for him so I can be in the studio\", he once recalled ˆ and the album follows Coxsone's recent strategy of overdubbing signature rhythms. While the Studio One sides were aimed at the dancefloor; Hudson's reworks of alltime classic tracks like \"Melody Maker\", all darkside funkadelic guitars and brooding feeling, are more psychological. Deep Barrett Brothers rhythms are remixed like you've never heard, deeper still with reverb, filters and other distortion, pitched down, everything; and overlaid with new recordings, often heavily treated, of wahwahed guitars, percussion, keyboard, voice. \"Playing It Cool..\" is legendary, strange, utterly compelling music. less"

   "name": "Foreign Experiences was commissioned by Performing Artservices, Inc. (1993) with funds from the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust. The opera was premiered by the Robert Ashley Ensemble at the Festival d'Avignon in 1994. \"This realization is a duet version by Sam Ashley and Jacqueline Humbert. The pre-recorded voices of the Ashley ensemble are the background chorus. Robert Ashley's NOW ELEANOR'S IDEA is a quartet of short operas based on the notion of a sequence of events seen from four, different points of view. At the same time, each opera is an allegory, like Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, for an individual's self-realization within the context of a major religion found in the United States. Improvement takes its imagery and plot from Judaism, Foreign Experiences from Pentecostal Evangelism, eL/Aficionado from Corporate Mysticism, and Now Eleanor's Idea from (Spanish) Catholicism. The inspiration for these works came specifically from four sources: the work of the historian, Frances A. Yates (1900-1983), whose specialty of interests included the influence of Kabbalistic mysticism on the birth of modernism and scientific philosophy in Italy in the 16th century (as a result of the expulsion of Jews from Spain during the Inquisition); the writings of Carlos Castaneda (and the arguments about him as a writer and about the intentions of his work); Low Rider Magazine, the fan-cult magazine of the Low Rider movement in the Southwestern United States; and finally, corporate vocabulary, what it sounds like and how it is used in popular publications, like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal or Fortune Magazine. The story, as Robert Ashley tells it — Don Jr. has come to California with his family -- Linda and Jr. Jr. -- and his friend, \"N,\" to take a job at a small college. They have moved from the Midwest of fractured identities to the world of no identities. California is the end of the Earth. That feeling is passed on from generation to generation without anyone recognizing that it is part of them. And it is passed on to the most recent arrivals. Even today in the precious palaces of Malibu, in the vast developments between Los Angeles and San Diego, in the spreading domestic comfort of the San Francisco Bay area it’s there. It poisons our movies and TV shows. It generates the most violent and interesting mystery novels. Even now jet travel doesn’t cure it. It comes down on you hard when you get off the plane and step outside the terminal. It drives some people mad.\" less"

Alvin Lucier: \"I am sitting in a room\" In I am sitting in a room, several sentences of recorded speech are simultaneously played back into a room and re-recorded there many times. As the repetitive process continues, those sounds common to the original spoken statement and those implied by the structural dimensions of the room are reinforced. The others are gradually eliminated. The space acts as a filter; the speech is transformed into pure sound. All the recorded segments are spliced together in the order in which they were made and constitute the work. I am sitting in a room was composed in 1970 and was first performed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City that same year.

Since that time, numerous versions of this composition have been realized in various ways by other musicians, including a Swedish radio broadcast version.

Three of Ashley's landmark recordings, Automatic Writing (1979), Purposeful Lady Slow Afternoon (1971) and She Was A Visitor (1967). \"Composed in recorded form over a period of five years, Automatic Writing is the result of Robert Ashley's fascination with involuntary speech. He has recorded and analyzed the repeated lines of his own mantra and extracted four musical characters. The result is quiet, mysterious, melancholy and an early form of ambient music. Purposeful Lady Slow Afternoon, and She Was a Visitor are excerpts from an opera entitled That Morning Thing that was composed in 1966Ð67, as a result of Ashley's impulse to express something about the suicides of three friends, in particular the intellectual problem of the idea of suicide. The opera takes the form of an alternation of scenes of rationalizations (or explanations) and scenes of descriptions. Purposeful Lady Slow Afternoon is a woman's description of a sexual experience. It is Ashley's attempt \"to demonstrate the dichotomy between the rational-whatever can be explained in words-and its opposite-which is not irrational or a-rational, but which cannot be explained in words.\" The lead voice, the processed back-up chorus, the recurring bell tone, and the pervading tape hiss, create an unsettling mood. She Was a Visitor is another form of description, it is intended to be understood as a form of rumor. The chorus is divided into groups, each headed by a leader. A lone speaker repeats the title sentence throughout the entire performance. The separate phonemes of this sentence are picked up freely by the group leaders and are relayed to the group members, who sustain them softly and for the duration of one natural breath. The time lag between the group leaders' phoneme choices and those phonemes being picked up by members of the group produces a staggered, chant-like effect, with the sounds moving outward from the nearest performer to the farthest.Booklet notes by Robert Ashley.\" less"

Several EBows (small electromagnets used primarily with electric guitars) which would cause the piano strings to vibrate and sound are placed on the strings of the piano. The pianist works from a prose score which describes the process and suggests she freely position and reposition five EBows on the piano strings, creating strands of sounds of varying density and texture. Much of her time is spent listening for harmonics, audible beating, occasional rhythms produced as one or more magnets vibrates against adjacent strings, and other acoustic phenomena. Theme: Setting a poem of John Ashbery's to music, Lucier didn't want to violate the flow of the words of the poem by fragmentation or any other cut-up method. The stanzas seemed musical enough just as they were and he wanted the audience to hear the poem more or less in its pristine state, so, working intuitively and by ear, he wrote out the poem for four readers in the order it was written, repeating words and phrases, overlapping and superimposing them in various ways. To \"set\" the poem, he inserted microphones into the mouths of various vessels, including a small milk bottle, a sea shell, a vase and an empty ostrich egg, to pick up the words as they were sounding inside the vessels. The readers speak normally, allowing the pitches of their voices which match those resonances of the vessels to create musical sounds. Occasionally, however, a reader will tend to emphasize certain pitches more than others, reading in an almost chant-like way, to sound the resonances of the vessels more clearly. Theme is performed on this CD by Sam Ashley, Thomas Buckner, Jacqueline Humbert and Joan La Barbara. Music for Gamelan Instruments, Microphones, Amplifiers and Loudspeakers: Wanting to make a work for Javanese gamelan, but wary of using someone else's music in his own work, it wasn't until he started imagining the bowl-shaped bonangs of the gamelan orchestra more as resonant chambers to be sounded than objects to be struck, that Lucier felt he could make a work for gamelan that he could call his own. During the performance four players place bonangs of various sizes over microphones, creating feedback, the pitch of which is determined by the shape and size of the bowl and the resonant characteristics of the room. Three gender players strike the bars on their metallaphones, searching for the pitches of the feedback strands. Since it is virtually impossible that a strand of feedback will match exactly a pitch on any fixed-pitch instruments, audible beats--bumps of sound which occur as sound waves coincide--occur. The closer the tuning, the slower the beating. When the players reach near-unison with a feedback strand they slow down or speed up their playing, creating beating patterns between the pitches of their instruments and those of the feedback.\" less"

The three operas are not a “trilogy” in any sense, but they all come from this preoccupation with or fascination with special kinds of speech and special kinds of states of mind. “The characters I’m interested in,” Ashley explains, “are marginal, because everybody is marginal compared to the stereotypes. I am interested in their profoundly good qualities, and I’m not interested at all in evil. The characters in my work are as bizarre and unreal as the characters in William Faulkner. They just happen to be ordinary people who are spiritually divine.” (The Wire, 2003). Though in Concrete it is not made explicit in any way, the libretto might be considered to be the “musings” of an old man alone. He thinks about strange questions and even as the questions are asked they are answered in various forms of sarcasm, indifference, questions about the questions and explanations. In other words, he is talking to himself. The opera takes the form of five “discussions” about matters he wonders about: Why do people keep secrets about themselves? Why do the buildings in the city all line up perfectly (vertically) when the surface of the planet is round? Why is it that so many things that people do as recreation are played counter-clockwise? What has happened to the many women friends (“lovers”) he has had and “left behind” and why were they left behind? And, finally, the fact that he has recently seen a “flying carpet” (in his bedroom.) The five “internal” discussions alternate with four reminiscences about people the old man has worked with and loved. The reminiscences are short and detailed biographies of seemingly ordinary people who in the past did extraordinary things — sometimes criminal, sometimes just brave in an unusual way — but will never be recognized for what they did. The stories will never be known, except to the audience. No one is named. These are secret lives. The singers in the opera are not “characters” in any traditional way. They take part in the very fast “discussions” sections as voices in the old man’s musings. Then each of the singers is given one of the “biographies” as a solo aria.\" less"

Given their proximity to Thailand, the music of Southern Laos perhaps understandably bears resemblance to the Thai folk-pop style of Molam in their singing, as documented in some of the LP’s most charming pieces, such as the slow, elegant sway of ‘Lao Lam Saravan’, but our personal highlights are the beguiling instrumentals, including the mesmerising metallic scrapes and glances of ‘Brao Lave Gongs’ from the Brao minority, as well as the beautifully drowsy ‘Alak Gongs’ of the Alak minority, played by three elderly performers surrounded by crowing cockerels and tropical fauna.

Of Rahbek's many projects, his most eloquent and gentle is Croatian Amor. 2017’s single 'Finding People' bloomed from Croatian Amor's previous album, the widely acclaimed 'Love Means Taking Action'. These melancholic transmissions presented a kind of alien pop. For 'Isa', he has drawn on an impressive list of guests to realise a nauseating narrative of virtual communication and eschatological programming. The album's title invokes a messianic entity, and though it's hard to tell what's imagined or remembered anymore, the play that Croatian Amor is known for feels far more vivid today. \"Enhance photo to reveal a picture of Bird caught mid-flight; enhance again, the bird has a human face screaming.\" Never pessimistic, Croatian Amor circles themes of tragedy and comfort to animate a sense of hope. His accomplices pluck details from his graphic scenes like a searchlight drifting over a starlit surface. Alto Aria, Soho Rezanejad, and Jonnine Standish of HTRK, each contribute vocals across the album, cloaked and kerned on Croatian Amor's inimitable stage. Eden 1.1 and its accompaniment Eden 1.2 feature the voices of Frederikke Hoffmeier and Yves Tumor, respectively. These are some of album's most delicate pieces, and where one may find respite from the helix of damaged rhythms that eddy across 'Isa'. Familiar faces from Copenhagen are solicited throughout, and perhaps the album's most endearing quality is the space for volatility that all of the collaboration has invited.

Setting up her famous long string instrument in the 26 metre length of Stockholm’s Kronobageriet - Sweden’s former royal bakery - Ellen Fullman brings a lifetime of dedication to her unwieldy and uniquely resonant instrument, while preeminent improvising cellist Okkyung Lee acts as a more agile counterpoint, subtly contrasting Ellen’s glacial cadence with a broader range of quicker strokes and pointed extended technique. Produced by John Chantler and recorded by Maria Horn during the First Edition Festival for Other Music, Stockholm on 20th February 2016, ‘The Air Around Her’ takes its title from a quote in ‘Vermeer Interiors’, a poem by Margaret Rabb, from her book ‘Granite Dives’. In both parts, Ellen and Okkyung play with sound as light, conducting a tonal shadowplay of inherently vast scope and ambition that comes with any recordings of Ellen’s long string instrument, as it always requires a good deal of time and space to properly tune and set up. The results are swept around the space of the old bakery, captivating in their keening swoons and nimble plies, and also the smoothness and friction of their flux of overtones, seeming to coruscate and bend in mid-air in tingling ecstasies, always pulling the ear to the full extent of the room’s parameters.

   "name": "Nocturnal Emissions’ dark ambient archetype and master opus sees light of day on its 30th anniversary reissue with Alessandro Adriani’s Mannequin. Starting a very welcome programme of Nocturnal Emissions reissues, ‘Spiritflesh’ offers a steeply absorbing blend of field recordings, concrète and analogue electronics recorded in London Zoological Gardens, the Derbyshire Dales and various sites in Great Britain between January and May 1988. With sleight of hand and near magic realist intent, the eldritch, future-primitivist results beautifully and brutally evoke a strong sense of time and place, and confirm Nocturnal Emissions position at the vanguard of post-industrial exploration. Written in the first half of 1988 and self-released by Nigel Ayers’ Nocturnal Emissions in 1989, after a decade of veering between noise, synth-pop and multi-disciplinary A/V performance, ‘Spiritflesh’ found the group perversely avoiding the acid house phenomenon and heading to the outer limits of sonic perception. Combining the indigenous, British sounds from the bleak Derbyshire Dales with Church harmonium, Car Wipers, and the relatively exotic sounds of Chimpanzees and African Wildfowl, the ten tracks speak to an idea of GB as a node, criss-crossed by eons of people, cultures, and their beliefs and occult ephemera. In effect, the music feels like a detached, psychic reading of the country at that time, when contemporary folk were engaged in technologically and pharmaceutically enhanced reveries that related as much to ancient African and pagan Indo-European traditions as up-to-the-second advancements in science and technology - effectively reading the aura of a country and culture tilting from analogue into the digital dimension. less"

In fact, with Cosey’s utterly mind-blowing autobiography, Art Sex Music now in circulation, putting history to rights and stoking febrile interest around her inspirational, nonpareil oeuvre, the timing could hardly be any better to reissue her most sought-after and inarguably definitive solo release. First issued on tape in 1983, some years after the initial demise of Throbbing Gristle and the start of of Chris & Cosey, and just prior to the emergence of their multimedia CTI alias, Time To Tell documents Hull’s greatest daughter, Christine Carol Newby aka Cosey Fanni Tutti, ‘fessing all about her long-running art praxis involving a deep penetration of the British sex industry - from nude modelling to striptease and transgressive performance art - all set to her signature, exploratory electronic sculptures and drily angelic delivery. For this hugely important reissue of Cosey’s only solo record (yep, only!), she worked with husband and creative partner Chris Carter to edit the original two track release, trimming down some of the longer parts to optimise audio fidelity, and also incorporating The Secret Touch which was included on the Time To Tell (Special Edition) CD release in 1993/2000. Thus the release spies three distinct strands or aspects of Cosey’s sound. The first, longest and most comprehensive is the LP’s title track, which, as far as we can tell, appears in a slightly abridged version, but still ties up all her key sonic themes, from pulsing, sensuous synths, sky-licking guitars and brittle drum machines to her achingly seductive Yorkshire accent, drily recounting her experiences and inside/out perspective in the sex industry. Tell us this isn’t one of the most alluring 20 minutes of the ‘80s ever recorded, and we’ll tell you to do one. Ritual Awakening comes on the B-side. Here the drum machine drops away and Cosey’s hushed vocals take a new, diaphanous form, refracted in a diamond-cut prism of electronics with near-cinematic strings, feeling out unreachable edges of the lushest void. Then we’re stranded in The Secret Touch, where her sallow synth strokes hint at an aquarian sort of new age, melding with reverberating, Denny-esque guitar against an unfathomable backdrop of possible field recordings and almost raga-like drones on her signature Cornet. We could hammer on about this one all day, but suffice it to say: this is a totally essential purchase! less"

   "name": "Chris Carter plugs a large gap in his discography with ‘Miscellany’, containing a previously unreleased batch of cosmic ‘70s synth abstractions, plus the first ever vinyl pressings of ‘‘Disobedient’ and ’Small Moon’, as well as a new edition of his classic ‘Mondo Beat’ [1985]. For any self-respecting fan of Throbbing Gristle, X-TG, Carter Tutti, or CTI, this is a genuinely essential motherload direct from source. Arriving in the wake of the influential synthesist’s ‘Chris Carter Chemistry Lessons Vol.1’, this boxset extends a necessary catch-up to many listeners, as well as a salve to collectors who can now complete their Chris Carter vinyl collections. Between the four respective albums inside, Mute survey the years prior to Carter’s pivotal debut ‘The Space Between’ [1980], which was recorded in the run-up to TG’s original demise, and the years post his participation in the short but extremely bright early phase of the world’s most notorious band. The ‘Archival Recordings’ disc is perhaps of greatest interest, historically and artistically. Spanning 1973-77, it covers the years just before, and after, Throbbing Gristle’s conception, when Carter was clearly in thrall to kosmische and psychedelia, but not beholden to them. Across 13 parts, Carter’s take on space music and pulsing early electronics is definitely less whimsical, much darker than other music of that period, progressing chronologically over the LP to reveal a full embrace of electronic music’s dark allure by the time we get to the hellish miasma of ‘See Sick’ [1977]. However, if we follow that chronologic logic beyond his years spent in TG (1975-1981), it’s clear to hear that Carter’s music becomes less dark and more sensual, funked and melodic with the languid lines and supple rhythms of ‘Mondo Beat’, including the classic ‘Moonlight’ which would become a dance anthem around Europe and the US (and reissued by Optimo in 2011). Skipping a grip of classic CTI and Carter Tutti material, that logic also extends to ‘Disobedient’ and ’Small Moon’, issued over 1998 and 1999, and exploring inquisitive strains of sound design more mystic/etheric, than outright dark, noisy or “Industrial” - all quite symptomatic of late ‘90s PMT. less"

In her previous outings we were struck by Anna’s taste for dissonance and an intense, pulsating sort of feminine pressure, and find those elements in majestic effect over the two long pieces contained within this LP - only her 2nd full solo album since 2003. Abstract in its stoic, precisely sculpted and beat-less arrangement, yet organically evolving in its layered harmonic chaos, Go Go Theurgy divines a free-floating space at once powerfully driven by rhythm, yet due to the absence of any tangible percussion defines a lush, keening, and pensile tension whose effect is only heightened when she abruptly veers off into passages of pizzicato pointillism. It could be considered dance music in a most extreme, physical form - with proper amplification both sides have the potential to exert serious G-force torque, liberating the body from the mind, and vice versa - but the underlying structures which reveal themselves with subsequent listens also lend themselves to comparison with proper classical music, especially in the staggering, Wagnerian turn of phrase that cleaves side two, before it calves into an almost asphyxiating, head-curdling final passage.

On the surface a tragic tale of a love triangle between a king, a young girl, and her suitor, the myth of ‘The Sorrow of Derdriu’ is also a metaphor for matters of national sovereignty, a concept sorely close to the hearts of folk in Scotland and Ireland right now. While that idea is never made explicit in the music, there’s an earthily rich and ancient sense of soul to Mac-Talla Nan Creag’s sounds and arrangements that suggest, whilst we might have hand-spinners and perfectly bevelled phones in our hands, not so much has changed over the past 2500 years.

Partly echoing Mark Fisher’s notions about the adverse links between capitalist realism and mental health, in concept and effect Lee’s 7 concise tracks feel to limn the exoteric soundsphere of life in dense city areas, shared spaces where we’re ubiquitously hammered with slogans, “seductive” advertising and even subliminal messaging such as the hyper directional speakers attached to billboards described in Steve Goodman’s essential ‘Sonic Warfare’ tome. If those commonly accepted facets of everyday life can be considered as exerting a sort of sferic, psychic damage upon their recipients, Lee’s music can be heard to simultaneously diagnose and offers a sort of therapy for the condition. Using language of cinematic sound design, the dynamic of the street (the doppler effect, overheard conversations), and the reverberations of club music, the EP moves quick and slow, patiently yet swiftly flowing the gaseous olfactory/visual sonic synaesthetia of ‘Fata Morgana’ to the polytheistic ambient hyperrealism of ‘Many Gods, Many Angels’ via bittersweetly anxious arps of ‘Folding’, somehow soothingly brutal psychoacoustics in ‘BMW Shuanghuan X5’, and the paradoxical state of static flight in the rapid-eye electro flux of ‘In The Wreck Room’. less"

After nearly five years spent inverting dub styles on a series of acclaimed releases for Bokeh Vesions, The Tapeworm, Anòmia, Ecstatic and Berceuse Heroique, on ‘Epitaph’ JGD effectively collapses his other aliases - singer/songwriter project Ku, and freeform experimental styles as The Hydra - into a compelling, holistic sound making strong use of his own vocals amid some of the most disorientating sound designs and devilish rhythms in his swelling catalogue. With an alchemical grasp of elemental chaos, the Athenian artist recalibrates what you know about Jay Glass Dubs, doubling down on the psychedelic intensity while also pushing a sore sense of soul to the fore. The results stagger out of time and place, bulldozing boundaries and perceptions of meter and space whilst always keeping a cool head at the centre of the madness. The paradoxical states of stasis/motion, chaos/coolness, ancient/futuristic have always been key to JGD’s aesthetic and appeal, but here they’re pushed to dizzying degrees. He places listeners at the centre of a cosmic storm full of clashing pressure systems, pushing and pulling the senses between alien chorales and landslide dub subsidence in ‘Seikilos & to Console Him’, before tumbling wildly down the labyrinthine corridors of tail-chasing breakbeats in ‘Animal Estate’, and sucking us into Charles Hayward-like psych-jazz-rock zones on ‘The Evil Empire’. The rest of the album only gets deeper under the skin, with plangent interludes and an oddly placed ‘intro’ sandwiching his aching, shoegaze-like beauty ‘A New Model for Emulation’, and leading to meditative militancy of ‘Laid Down’, with its piledriving percussion and arcane trance synths, before that curdled, alien croon comes back into play like the maddest Rhythm & Sound session you’ve never heard on ‘To My Benefitors’, and the reticulated dembow rhythms of ‘Reckless’ leave us reeling in a bombed out no-man’s-land where synthetic sirens call from the trenches. less"

Using a synchronised swimming speaker and hydrophones, Kate takes acoustic readings of the natural and manmade properties of the sea and its liminal zones of transition everywhere from the north-east coast of Scotland to the most westerly point in Ireland and a fjord in Iceland. The results are parsed, manipulated and layered to poetically limn a series of psychogeographic studies inmparted with a curiously compelling narrative quality. Taking a poem by Adrienne Rich, ‘Diving Into There Wreck’ as inspiration for the track titles of ‘The Thing Itself and not the Myth,’ Carr spellbindingly uses her own poetic license to shape a uniquely immersive experience, vacillating feelings of dread and isolationism with pangs of tranquility and elemental lushness that hypnotically connote her subject’s vast spectrum of spaces, textures, and their endless flux. Oblique, then vivid, abstract and hyperreal, Kate’s intersection of morse code, honking geese, clanking hulls and dark green-brownian slosh can be heard as an attempt to grasp the logic, or the clinamen of the sea and its incessant tussle with land. The level of detail and natural effortlessness to Kate’s compositions most beautifully acknowledges the infinite complexity of the thing itself, and our metaphysical, emotive connections to it. less"

This was an important time for me. Three years later, I had honed that sound into Afro-Juju, and my ‘Ace: Afro Juju Series 1’ album broke me as an artist. On ‘Sewele’, Peters explores different themes on four extended juju workouts, showcasing his incredible guitar work and his sense of fun as the odd Bob Marley and Abba riff pops up in the grooves. The title track means ‘shower of blessings’: “it’s like a prayer for my fans throughout Nigeria and the diaspora.” The funky Afrobeat of ‘Yabis’ is about being proud to be African and not to follow American ways and ‘Agbe’ere De’ states proudly that Peters is coming again with something different: “I always wanted to get the message across to my fans that I was keeping things fresh and creating melodies and music that people would enjoy.” The final track, ‘Late Aboderin’, is a moving tribute to Peters’ mentor, the late Chief Aboderin: “He helped me in many ways including legal aid in a court case against a record label.

Her most recent project was a sound installation that featured an ambitious choral work, performance artists and a unique speaker diffusion system. Part of Beyond the Deepening shadow at the Tower of London, it ran from 4-11 November and saw over 300,000 visitors, creating an international media storm. The basis for the new EP title and lead track – rightclick – was Utopia, a Random Acts film written and directed by internationally acclaimed novelist Adam Thirwell (released on 6 December 2018). In the short film starring Lily Cole and Lily McMenamy, a girl tries to set up a commune in a tiny apartment and finds her ideals of utopian living tested and expanded as an alternate version of Calix’s fragmented track acts as the bedrock throughout. “the past few years I’ve been making mostly installation, which I find thrilling, but the nature of my practice means I tend to work with many hands, many speakers, many materials, many musicians over long periods.

To close out the year that was, we are pleased to present Heckadecimal’s ‘Murder Tape.’ A Minneapolis-based producer and acid auteur, Heckadecimal has been a fixture within the vibrant Midwestern electronic music community for nearly 20 years. Founder of the legendary ‘Anti-human’ events and co-curator of the ever-prolific Always Human Tapes imprint – alongside Ryan Wurst and Peter Lansky – Heckadecimal’s reputation is one of unrelenting creativity and tireless advocacy for sonic experimentation. His work has found its way to light via a slew of pseudonyms and stage monikers, including The Worm, noface and Wonder Sirens. In short – Heckadecimal lives and breathes the sonic matter that he leaves pouring out of studio monitors, busted bar systems and finely tuned rave stacks, wherever his travels take him. Live performance lies at the core of Heckadecimal’s practice. When he stormed through Inciting HQ in Philly earlier this summer, he took command over an arsenal of hardware that reminded us of how Octave One or Shawn Rudiman might show up. These were machines that he had lived with; touched with custom modifications, hand-drawn stickers and pockmarks incurred in battle, one got the sense that the gear was a personal extension of the artist. Perhaps it’s a bit maudlin, but we feel a certain kinship with this project. Indeed, these tracks at times feel very much of a piece with the gnarled tonalities in which our stable typically traffics; all low-slung riddims that reach at equal lengths towards mutated IDM aesthetics and post-Packard Plant techno extrusions. These are future perfect grooves that glide along under the vast Midwestern sky, providing a fertile communication conduit with the City of Brotherly Love.” less"

Hearkening back to a time before the spectral, romantic electric guitar vignettes for which he is celebrated, ‘Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations Vol. 10’ was intended as the 10th volume in a series of solo acoustic guitar improvisations released on his label, Dagget Records. But the distributor went bankrupt, leaving the car-less Connors to dispose of the unsold stock rather than drag the records home. However, thanks to a recording found by Unseen Worlds’ Tommy McCutcheon in Columbia University Libraries archival collections, this remarkable side is finally set to find its audience nearly 40 years later. For anyone not au fait with this period of Connors work, ‘Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations Vol. 10’ offers a shocking contrast with his possibly better known and exquisitely tender later work. The deftness is still patently there, but the results are jaggedly raw and perhaps best compared with his transatlantic blues brother Derek Bailey, strung out in an array of wildly pitch-bent yanks and wails that could be described as expressions of heartbroken despair, laments for lost souls, or possessed by spirits, depending your own take. In Connors’ hands, here the history of the blues and country collapses into the brink of abstraction, but, most crucially, his music remains integrally tied to those styles, with Connors acting as a conductive vessel for a swarm of hard-bitten ghosts to say their piece. less"

He cut his teeth as a career jazzman with Humphrey Lyttleton, before an extended stint with the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band. On this rare 1979 duo outing, he sticks to clarinet. And though that instrument has an illustrious jazz pedigree, Coe’s playing here is something else. It’s worth noting that the clarinettist has also played under the baton of arch-modernist Pierre Boulez, the kind of composer Derek Bailey enjoyed taking to task in his book Improvisation. You might think the Frenchman’s uncompromising serialism and the free playing Bailey defended with such passion all his life would have little in common, yet both men were hugely influenced by Anton Webern. It’s an influence you can hear right through Bailey’s career in his obsessive exploration of tight parcels of registrally-fixed pitches, notably those trademark ringing harmonics. Meanwhile, Coe’s meandering semitones and sinuous arabesques here recall both Boulez’s clarinet writing in Domaines, and the harmonic world of Boulez’s own teacher Olivier Messiaen. Still, no traditional classical musical notation could ever render the extraordinary rhythmic subtlety and timbral complexity of this music. It’s at one and the same time dazzlingly virtuosic — Coe and Bailey are on stellar form throughout, and have enough sense to, yes, accompany each other where needs be — and supremely lyrical and spacious.

   "name": "Blume is fast becoming one of the most crucial contemprary imprints for new and archival electronic and electro-acoustic works - and this one has once again completely destroyed us. If you’ve been snagged on the ideas and effects of sides from Áine O’Dwyer, Jim O’Rourke’s Steamroom archive, Julius Eastman or indeed Blume’s Mary Jane Leach edition, we wager this one will floor you. The exceptional Blume series have us rapt on the edge of our listening seats with Sarah Hennies’ striking works for percussion; 'Foragers' and 'Embedded Environments', a pair of sui generis modern compositions for four players which make staggering, contrasting use of the acoustics at “Silo City” in Buffalo, NY. In admirable, riveting pursuit of a singular sound that best represents Hennies’ identity, Embedded Environments documents her strive to achieve a sort of 3rd track or space severed from the cultural baggage of cis-gendered tradition. In order to do so, Sarah stripped hers and the players instrumental gestures down to the barest minimum of repetitive patterns which didn’t imply or appropriate this or that culture, then used the human-made acoustics of the silos to allow those sounds to mix freely, embracing the aleatoric complexity of those results, once created and released into the huge resonant chamber. Documented in long form on each side, the results of her incisive approach vary broadly. The rolling waves of pressure from Foragers are notably intense but barely there, while Embedded Environments is raucous by comparison, yet in their own way, they both share a futuristic primitivism that’s entirely rooted in the moment of here and now. In the first, a chronically low rumble sustains a meditative pressure that’s neither new age nor connoting religious or even erotic themes. Rather its a reinforcement of presence redolent of some aspects of work by Alvin Lucier, and sharing a canny trick in common with Áine O’Dwyer’s Gallarais when the hypnotic effect is broken by the sound of a plane passing overhead, ripping us out of one sphere and into another and then back in a way that’s subtly crude and completely shocking to experience. On the other hand, Sarah’s B-side takes the kind of drums you may associate with Native American ritual practise, and sends them spiralling skyward, outward to find their own paths beyond pastiche, pressed by a timeless sense of urgency and near seething aggression directed at the foundations of restrictive institutions. As a record of our times, Embedded Environments acknowledges the stale accretion of psychogeographic and socio-political sonics, the binds of self-censorship, and the “norms” of contemporary composition, and seeks to plough for the now with a raging sort of stasis that’s perhaps an apt metaphor for the current status quo. As the liner notes by Bradford Bailey put it, \"What She Has to Say, Has Never Been Said\". Incredible work. less"

   "name": "Jesus this album is incredible. Heather Leigh channels Kate Bush and Coil via lapsteel guitar and staggering vocals on a her new album for Editions Mego. Following her previous solo LP ‘I Abused Animal’ for Stephen O’Malley’s Ideologic Organ with a record that few beyond her inner circle could have predicted. Epic in scope, devastating on impact. Do not miss this one! “Heather Leigh takes her Throne as queen of pedal steel with a suite of heartbleed ballads cauterised with burning riffs. After the rawness of its precursor I Abused Animal, Throne is a record of late night Americana and heavy femininity; intimate love songs smoked in sensuality. The songs on Throne are woozy, gorgeous and uncomfortable, smothered in thick layers of bass but lifted by multitracked vocals. These are rich song forms that stand in contrast to the stripped down steel in her duo with Peter Brotzmann. Prelude To Goddess sashays in wearing leopard print jeans under the twinkling fluorescent illuminations of the British seaside, like Brighton Rock with extra bass. It is followed in by Lena – arguably Leigh's Jolene – a perverse love song soaked in a subversive sexuality, weighed down with a heavy pulse. Soft Seasons is anchored with sunken beats shrouded in wailing, growling steel and an earwormy melody. Gold Teeth, the longest track on the record, crests and breaks in waves; ecstatic peaks balanced and echoed by melancholic troughs. It soars on an updraft, and from cosmic heights dives seaward into a gnarly and riotous pedal steel breakdown, before catching the breeze again. Days Without You and Scorpio & Androzani are shorter, intimate songs, in the latter the synths seethe and the steel bows and bends as Leigh's voice falters above a Greek chorus of shadows and reflections. But this isn't autobiography, and Throne departs on Days Without You, a confrontationally unfinished romantic song, anxious with half-thoughts and missed connections. It glides into the night on stilettos leaving unanswered questions, in a fug of psychic disturbance and lovesick sensuality. Leigh's artwork (which she photographed and designed) is a visual mirror of the songs on Throne. It is an album of cosmic echoes, abstractions and introspection, of characters and stories that make up Leigh's first best pop record, its melodies and hooks set alight with the fiery core of her unique and distinctive pedal steel. - Jennifer Lucy Allen, 2018” less"

   "name": "'Live Knots' presents two immersive live recordings of Oren Ambarchi playing the epic 'Knots' from 'Audience Of One' (Touch, 2012) in Tokyo and Krakow's Unsound Festival. Captured with alternately intimate and widescreen fidelity, the original elements of cyclonic guitar harmony and quicksilver percussion are twisted different ways across the two performances, exploring and testing every nuance of the track's framework. 'Tokyo Knots' intimately documents their show at SuperDeluxe in March 2013, Ambarchi cautiously stalking Joe Talia's prickling, Dejohnette-esque percussion with viscose bass tone and heady harmonic incense, progressively whipping up a free form storm of buzz-saw guitar attacks and crashing drums, organically resolving to a lean motorik groove flecked with spring reverb. By contrast, the twice-as-long performance of 'Krakow Knots', featuring Sinfonietta Cracovia led by Eyvind Kang on viola, presents a more expansive reading of the same structure, adding a prelude of sliding string dissonance before swelling against Talia's adroit patter with a burgeoning tension, ratcheting the mid-section squall to blistering barrage of buzz-saw flares and strobing fuzz, before burning out to reveal a captivating resolution of string glissandi swept against Joe Talia and Crys Cole's skittish percussion objects and retching spring reverb. The applause at the end is very well earned. less"

   "name": "A cocktail of sultry disco from late night ‘80s Tokyo, compiled by Toshiya Kawasaki for Mule Musiq “Midnight In Tokyo is a compilation series that aims to be the perfect companion to nights in Tokyo, collecting tracks by Japanese artists that sound best at night. Vol. 2 (STUDIOMUL 006CD/LP, 2018) focused more on '80s jazz fusion, but the latest installment, Vol. 3, picks up where Vol. 1 (STUDIOMUL 001CD/LP, 2018) left off, bringing together forgotten soul, disco, and new wave gems. The compilation opens with Japanese rare groove classic \"More Sexy,\" a provocative song by Yoko Hatanaka. \"Kimi No Yume,\" from the album Yume No Yonbai (1984) by Masumi Hara, is one of the best Balearic acid folk songs to come from Japan. \"Silhouette Call\" is an electric bossanova track in the vein of Antena, from a rare album called Octopussy (1982) by Yuki Nakayamate, a singer-songwriter who worked with Motoharu Sano. \"Theme Of High School Student\" is a dubby cut featured in the Japanese film Kougen Ni Ressha Ga Hashitta (1984), written by Atsuo Fujimoto (Colored Music), one of the key artists in the recent wave of global interest in Japanese music. \"Get To Paradise\" is a stone-cold funk jam by Mari Kaneko, who was known as the Janis Joplin of Shimokitazawa. Following that is one of Japan's greatest new wave disco tracks, \"Hannya\", taken from Tomoko Aran's popular third album Fuyu-Kukan (1983) produced by Masatoshi Nishimura, who was part of Friends Of Earth with Haruomi Hosono. Masako Miyazaki, whose rendition of Seawind's \"He Loves You\" is a fan favorite, puts her own spin on Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Fantasy,\" singing in her accent-heavy English, giving the song an undeniable character. \"Watashi No Koukoku\" is a certified disco-boogie classic by Junko Sakurada. The Brazilian-esque jazz fusion, \"Sunshine Bright On Me\" is by fusion group Kangaroo, who were often billed as \"the japanese Shakatak\". \"Stranger's Night\" is a synth-pop number by Maiko Okamoto, which bears a suspicious resemblance to Rah Band's \"The Shadow Of Your Love\". Electro-pop disco \"Singing Lady\", off the sole album by The Fad sounds like something Giorgio Moroder could've cooked up. \"Magic Eyes\" is a disco anthem recorded by Tetsuji Hayashi's disco project, The Eastern Gang. Following that is Japanese soul gem \"Crazy Baby,\" found on a rare 7\" entitled Minato No Soul by Rinda Yamamoto also composed and arranged by Tetsuji Hayashi. Closing out this collection of 14 Japanese rare groove goodies is \"I'm In Love\", a bittersweet mellow dance number by Tomoko Aran.” less"

   "name": "After blessing Night School with the divine ambient pop of ‘Hilja’ - one of 2018’s most memorable albums - Cucina Povera, aka Finnish-born, Glasgow-based sound artist Maria Rossi, turns us to mush again with ‘Zoom’, a startling new album of plaintive choral hooks, murmuring vocals, and super minimal synth strokes. Recorded in intimate spaces full of \"acoustic or ideological intrigue\", primarily using nothing more than her own voice recorded through a VE20 vocal effects pedal directly into a Zoom H2N, the album becomes a materialist catalogue of the wonder of the every-day; a document of different locations and moods, a postcard look into the stream-of-consciousness of an artist developing her own language. It’s a much more stripped down affair than Cucina Povera’s debut ‘Hilja', literally breaking down to glossolalic gasps, single words and phonemes that drift in mellifluous cadence thru gently reverberant space. Occasionally her vocals form full phrases, and although they’re in Finnish, the information is really all imparted via that plaintive intonation and harmonic structuring. In this sense, she lives up to her moniker - relying on what’s to hand - vocals - in simple, but properly unusual and previously unheard combinations. Unlike the more ethereal vocal layering of, say, classic Grouper - 'Zoom' offers a much more stark set of songs; a vulnerable but defiant sound diary that we’ve returned to at least a dozen times in the short few weeks we’ve had it to hand. less"

   "name": "Including a previously unreleased Part 3, Sun Ra’s classic solo piano suite is comprehensively issued and available on digital format for the first time “\"I have always thought orchestra. I play that way, even when playing the piano.\" — Sun Ra Monorails and Satellites were two volumes of solo piano works recorded by Sun Ra in 1966. Volume 1 was issued on his Saturn label in 1968, volume 2 the following year. They were the first commercial LPs of the artist's solo keyboard excursions. Vol. 1 featured seven idiosyncratic Sun Ra originals and one standard delivered in Sunny's singular manner. Vol. 2 consists entirely of original compositions. A tape of a third, unreleased volume was discovered posthumously by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive. Released here for the first time, it consists of five originals and four standards, and was recorded in stereo. Despite Sun Ra's obsession with the future, Monorails and Satellites is something of a nostalgia trip. As a youth in Birmingham, Alabama, the man who became Sun Ra—Herman Poole Blount—spent hours at the Forbes Piano Company, amusing himself (as well as staff and customers) at the showroom keyboards. He practiced standards, emulated his piano heroes, played the latest pop songs, and improvised. The idyllic reveries which the teen experienced in those formative years were no doubt recaptured during the Monorails sessions. The playing here speaks less of a style, and more of a collection of statements. Some of the tunes, with their odd juxtapositions of mood, could be mistaken for silent film scores. Perhaps they were audio notebooks, a way to generate ideas which could be developed with the band (\"I think orchestra\"). Regardless of any secondary (and admittedly speculative) intent, they serve as compelling standalone works. The fingering reflects Sun Ra's encyclopedic knowledge of piano history as his passages veer from stride to swing, from barrelhouse to post-bop, from march to Cecil Taylor-esque free flights, with a bit of soothing \"candelabra\" swank thrown in. Sunny's attack is mercurial, his themes unpredictable. His hands can be primitive or playful, then abruptly turn sensitive and elegant. As with the whole of Sun Ra's recorded legacy, you get everything but consistency and predictability. The listener also experiences something rare in the Sun Ra recorded omniverse: intimacy. His albums, generally populated by the rotating Arkestral cast, are raucous affairs. With the Monorails sessions, we eavesdrop on private moments: the artist, alone with his piano. These are brief audio snapshots of what was surely a substantial part of Sun Ra's life, infinitesimal surviving scraps of 100,000 hours similarly spent, most lost to posterity.” less"

   "name": "Oslo/Berlin’s Bendik Giske uses extended technique and unique microphone placement to capture a visceral showcase of his virtuoso saxophone talents. Imagine Colin Stetson having an epiphany after a transformative time at Berghain… “Born in Oslo and splitting much of his adolescence between his home city and Bali, Giske grew up in an artistic household and took up the saxophone at the age of 12. As the years progressed, so did his comfort with the instrument, which inspired him to push the boundaries of what he could accomplish creatively with it. After spending much of the previous decade racking up contributions to others’ works, including several albums from Norwegian performance artist Nils Bech, Giske was inspired to conceive Surrender after a fateful trip to notorious Berlin club Berghain in 2012. “I resisted—I felt like everyone was an idiot,” he admits regarding the experience, which he now regards as transformative. “At some point, I started embracing this culture, and I realized that this is where I wanted to be and how I wanted to create in this universe. The space really creates a parallel universe that takes a while to get into—but once you surrender yourself to it, you experience yourself in a way that feels more true.” Surrender as a verb is a key concept to Giske’s debut. “I consider myself a queer performance artist—the queer perspective is always there,” he states. “In gay culture, we have the terms ‘top’ and ‘bottom,’ with ‘bottom’ referencing an act of surrender and trust. This act of surrender gives you a different perspective on how you relate to the world—how you apply yourself and experience things.” Recorded at Oslo’s Emanuel Vigeland Mausoleum, Giske and producer Amund Ulvestad conceived of the method in which they placed tiny microphones over the saxophonist’s instrument and body, right down to being able to capture his breathing between notes. Instrumental music is often at its best when telling a story within the notes it contains, and by that measure Surrender is an extremely relatable work of art for anyone who’s ever had a moment in a crowded room and felt themselves changing amidst the chaos of the world surrounding them.” less"

The trackless is stuffed with glittering gems, ranging from the very well known likes of Dinosaur L’s Paradise garage classic ‘Go Bang! (LP Version)’, thru to a necessary new pressing of Jean-Michel Basquiat’s amazing ‘Drum Mode’ as Gray (expensive to find on any other pressing!), and Rammellzee vs K-Rob’s avant hip hop touchstone ‘Beat Bop’. In between those classic high water marks of disco and early hip hop, the set also highlights those artists from the new wave/pop paradigm who were irrevocably influenced by the ingenuity of late ‘70s disco and dance music as much as punk and the drive of German krautrock. We’re talking Suicide’s Alan Vega with the swaggering ballistics of ‘Saturn Drive’; San Francisco’s Tuxedomoon with the special sauce of ‘Desire’; Talking Heads’ David Byrne with the bustle of ‘Big Business (Dance Mix)’; and the the needling, spiky funk of ‘Hold Up’ by 3 Teens Kill 4. less"

In 1977 and 1982 respectively, Conflict Dub and Dubbing In The Front Yard were released in London as white labels in extremely limited quantities. The two LPs found the triumvirate of Lee, Jammy and The Aggrovators in perfect form with driving instrumentals, flashes of vocal beauty and mixes that ripped apart and rebuilt traditional notions of sonic structure. Due to the nature of their limited release (not to mention the lack of artwork and even titles) the two dub LPs quickly disappeared into that mythic realm of records whispered about by only the most hard-core reggae collectors.
